Choice : 
Enter position (x and y) on detector in INTEGER
pixels (range = 0-799) or the filename of a list
of positions preceded by a '@' (ie. @xy.lis).

Position : 
Select filter passband :
    - Enter the name of the filter (eg. f555w)
    - Enter MONO to specify a single wavelength
Filter : 
1 wavelengths will be used to generate PSF

Assuming detector pixel size of 0.04555 arcsec

The maximum computable PSF size is 30.0 arcsec.
The recommended size is about 3.0 arcseconds.
What diameter should your PSF be (in arcseconds)? : 
Do you wish to generate a subsampled PSF? (Y/N) : Secondary mirror despace is scaled by 0.011 and added to Z4.
Focus, secondary mirror despace? [microns]: 
Rootname of PSF image files (no extension) : 
To execute the next stage, enter the command :
