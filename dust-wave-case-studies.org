Case studies of interesting objects for inclusion in bow paper X

* Selection criteria
+ High-ish ambient densities, since that is more likely to give an "interesting" case (e.g., radiation bow wave)
+ Prefer B stars to O stars, since then it is easy to get dust waves (gas--grain separation)


* Open questions
** Determining shell pressure from MIR observations
*** 70 micron peak brightness method
+ Kobulnicky 2018 do this using the Peak 70 micron emission from Herschel
  + Values are 4.6 \to 90 in units of 10^7 Jy/sr (median about 20)
    + So, 200 MJy/sr or \nu I_\nu = 0.008 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + Observationally, this is problematic since 70 micron 
+ ERO 21 has 4.5 Jy/pix = 18700 MJy/sr
  + 20 times higher than highest (900) in K18 sample
  + Background is 1.5 Jy/pix = 6230 MJy/sr
    + Confirmed with Akari 65 micron, although the source itself has disappeared (maybe point sources have been removed).  Also, Akari is roughly 25% brighter across the board
  + If we calculate U = 15 L4 / R_pc^2 with L4 = 0.63 and R_pc = 0.09, then U = 1160
  + This gives 70 micron emissivity of j_\nu = 2.5e-12 (Jy/sr) (cm^2/H) from K18 Fig 2
    + [ ] *NOTE* we need to recalculate j_\nu from the Cloudy models - I suspect that they should be higher for illuminating SEDs that are dominated by the UV.  The K18 graph uses Draine:2007a, which assumes an ISM SED
  + So dividing peak brightness by emissivity, we get a H column of 18700 1e6 / 2.5e-12 = 7.48e21 H/cm^2
  + Using m = 1.3 mp gives line of sight surface density: \sigma = 0.01626 g/cm^2
  + Assuming a limb-brightening boost factor of 5 and \kappa = 600 cm^2/g gives a perpendicular UV optical depth \tau = 1.95
  + /On the cusp between bow wave and radiation-supported bow shock/
  + We can also get the density:
    + Path length is about 6 Herschel pixels = 19.2 arcsec = 0.21 pc = 6.48e17 cm
      + With limb-brightening of 5, this gives shell thickness h = 0.042 pc = 1.30e17 cm
    + So mean density is n = 7.48e21 / 6.48e17 = 1.15e4 pcc
    + Could this be fully ionized?  Perpendicular emission measure is 1.3e17 1.15e4**2  = 1.71396e25 cm^-5
    + => required ionizing flux is 2.6e-13 1.71396e25 = 4.46e12 phot/cm^2/s
    + Given S49 = 0.00013, available ionizing flux is 1.34e9 phot/cm^2/s, so it must be mainly neutral
      + Assuming that bulk of column is at 1000 K, then the ionized density would be 20 times less => 575 pcc
      + Then, thickness of ionized layer would be 1.34e9 / 575**2 2.6e-13 = 1.56e16 cm = 0.005 pc
      + This is 0.12 times the total thickness, so ionized gas is only 0.006 times the total column
      + That would explain why we see no H alpha emission
+ Ero 5 has 0.025 Jy/pix = 100 MJy/sr but with large errors because of bright BG
  + This is the same as source 407 in K18, which gives 582 MJy/sr as peak brightness, which would be 0.14 Jy/pixel
  + Background is 0.45 Jy/pixel, so they are saying there is an excess of 30% of BG
  + Re-looking at the cuts, I think 0.14 is just about allowable if we assume that the BG falls off at the position of the bow, but that is extreme special pleading
+ ERO 36 or K18 406
  + The 70 micron emission can be measured more reliably in this object, since it has a better contrast with the continuum
    + 0.32 peak - 0.24 +/- 0.01 bg = 0.08 Jy/pix = 330 MJy/sr
    + K18 have 291 MJy/sr, so we actually agree!
    + BG is about 1000 MJy/sr at both 70 and 160 micron
    + So that is 57 times lower than for ERO 21
    +

* New "discoveries" in Orion
** B star bow shock over to E of M42
+ Shows up in the WISE maps
  + Also in Spitzer 24 micron
  + And in MSX 
+ Coordinates
  + 84.158869 -5.4750212
  + 5:36:38.129 -5:28:36.13
+ This has names
  + Brun 1018
  + Parenago 2425
+ Spectral type: B6V
+ Candidate driving source of CO shell 12 from Feddersen:2018a
  + Strangely, LP Ori is candidate for driving shell 11, which I don't believe
** Near infrared bow shock in North portion of Orion integral-shaped filament
+ This is between M42 and Sharpless 279, just 13 arcmin S of the latter
+ Seen in WSA YJHK images
  + http://wsa.roe.ac.uk
+ Coordinates:
  + 5:35:31.589 -5:00:13.43
  + 83.881677 -5.0040292
+ Certainly a bow shock, and seems to be centered on a star
  + But this may be a coincidence - possibly it is an HH object that just happens to be passing by
  + There is a reflection nebula to the S
  + [X] Need to check adjacent fields to the E, to see if there is any sign of a train of knots or a possible source
    + Turns out to be a well-studied region: Davis:2009a
    + Our object is crossed by SMZ2 outflow, but may not be related
  + [ ] Also need to check if they might be optical artefacts
** [#C] Strange feature near Orion Bar in mid-infrared

  + Turns out there is nothing at position of LL Ori
+ Coordinates of star 5:35:15.524 -5:25:14.15
+ We can see the bow shock clearly in Spitzer images
  + Highest contrast in IRAC 3 5.731 micron
  + Might be jet instead of bow, or indeed anything
+ Actually, there is another bow nearby, and maybe a 3rd one further N in the same field
+ There are also some clear jets, which do look different
+ Need to check out MIR bands
* MIR spectra of H II regions
+ Lots of times when people talk about H II region, what they really mean is PDRs and PAHs
+ But there are some real spectra of real ionized gas
+ They show *no* PAH emission, but strong VSG continuum
+ Also occasionally Silicate emission at 10 and 20 micron
+ And occasionally an emission band at 23 micron, possibly from FeO (see Koike:2017a)
+ Examples
  + NGC 3603 Lebouteiller:2007a
    + VSG emission is measured from continuum at 14 micron
    + Anticorrelates with PAH emission
    + VSG/PAH is high within 4 pc of star cluster
    + Intensity correlates with intensity of [S IV] line
    + PAH/VSG falls with [S IV]/[Ne II], which they call "hardness", but is really a proxy for ionization parameter
    + MIR diagnostic diagram
      + 6.2 micron PAH/6 micron continuum on x axis
      + 13.8/6 continuum ratio on y axis
      + Ionized region has y constant at about 40, finally decreasing to about 10 in the PDR
      + Values of x range from about 0.3 to 1.0 (and then higher, as you go into the PDR)
    + Cluster properties
      + D = 7 kpc, A_V = 4.5 (mainly foreground)
      + S = 1e51 /s in Ly-c
      + Lbol = 1e7 Lsun
    + Correlation with radiation field
      + U = 15 L4 / R^2 = 1.5e4 / R^2 with R in pc
      + Stellar wind cavity out to 1 pc with very little emission
      + Silicate emission for 1 to 2 pc => U > 4000
      + [S IV]/[Ne II] is supposedly "hardness", but I suspect will be more like ionization parameter.  For constant density, this will be a tracer of U.  But we will call it H
        + Reading Madden:2006a is more enlightening about this.  They are comparing regions between galaxies of different metallicities, so for them [Ne III]/[Ne II] really is diagnostic of the hardness of the radiation field.  But that won't necessarily be the case within a single cluster
        + Ratio is H = 1 at about 4 pc, so we would predict H = (R/4)^-2, which works well
          + H(R = 2) = 4 (observed 4)
          + H(R = 8) = 0.25 (observed 0.3)
        + So the prediction is H = U/1000 for this density
  + [ ] Other regions
+ Dopita:2008a on compact H II regions that are ionization bounded (plus PDRs out to column of 1e22 H/cm^2)
  + This has SEDs for different pressures and masses of star
    + M = 20 to 100 Msun
    + P/k = 1e6 to 1e9 at the i-front, corresponding to densities of 100 to 1e5 pcc
      + In Orion we have
        + P/k = 2e8 in Orion S region (0.02 pc)
        + P/k = 2e7 in Bar (0.2 pc)
        + down to P/k = 1e6 in EON (2 pc)
        + In theory it should be Q/4 pi R^2 = \alpha n^2 H
          + So that n \propto R^{-1} H^{-1/2}
          + Which would be R^{-3/2} if H \propto R
          + That fits the Bar-EON ratio OK, whereas R^-1 fits better the OrionS- Bar ratio

    + They find that the IR SEDs have luminosities of roughly the stellar luminosity in all cases, unsurprisingly
    + Low P/k have intense PAH band emission and continuum peaks at 60 micron
    + High P/k means that PAH goes away and dust continuum peaks at 20 microns, and we see the Silicate emission peaks
+ [ ] Zhu:2008a have kinematics of lots of compact H II regions in [Ne II] lines
  + Many sources have bow-shaped morphologies
  + They consider different models for the kinematics
    + A: Expanding shell
    + B: Expanding sphere
    + C: Bow shock
    + D: Parabolic shell with pressure-driven flow along the shell
    + E: Filled blister flow
  + /Comments/
    1. They do not fairly represent the blister flow.  They have it being very convex, which is not at all like Henney:2005a models.  Still, the predictions of flow perpendicular to bow should be easy to rule out
    2. They find most sources to be of type D, but there is really no difference between a slow-moving bow shock and their model D
       + I suppose it is different in the sense that the ionized velocity reached in the wings is not due to the relative velocity of the confining stream
  + We should look at some of these sources and see if they have IR SEDs available

* How to normalize the radiation field
+ This is related to [[id:33290714-FA0D-44D4-9541-2D54DD74E4D2][Compare Ly\alpha heating with stellar heating]] below
+ Relano:2016a is an interesting case study
  + They compare the Mathis:1983a ISRF with that produced by a 4Myr massive cluster
  + Unsurprisingly, the cluster SED is all UV, whereas the ISRF is only about 5% UV
  + They find that, using the cluster SED, they need to use a 60 times lower total flux in order to fit the same dust emission
* Conversions
+ Many maps use MJy/sr as brightness unit
  + Kobulnicky:2018a uses 10^7 Jy/sr
+ Salgado plots surface brightness SEDs as \nu I_\nu in erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg/s/cm^2/Hz
  + \nu = c / \lambda = 2.99792458e14  / \lambda(micron)
  + So, 1 MJy/sr means that \nu I_\nu = (0.003 / \lambda_\micro) erg/s/cm^2/sr
+ Herschel maps are in Jy/pixel, where pixel is 3.2 arcsec
  + 1 Jy/pixel = 4155 MJy/sr
  + 1 Jy/pixel @ 70 micron = 0.178 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + *No, this is only at 160* At 70 microns, they are 1.6 arcsec pixels, so multiply by 4
+ Flux in Jy
  + In each square arc second: 1 MJy/sr means 2.35e-5 Jy
  + In each square arc minute: 1 MJy/sr means 0.0846 Jy
* Wind radiative momentum efficiency for a broader class of objects
+ We can calculate \eta a lot more broadly than just for OB star winds
  + \eta = 0.495 Mdot(-7) V3 / L4
+ Wolf-Rayet stars
  + Can have \eta > 1, so radiation support is never important (unless \tau is high enough to trap the re-emitted IR radiation too)
+ Strong-wind T Tauri stars
  + Take L = 10 Lsun, Mdot = 1e-8, and V = 200 km/s
  + Gives \eta = 10, implying a non-radiative driving of the wind
+ Proplyds:
  + L = 0.1 Lsun, Mdot = 1e-8, V = 30
  + Gives \eta = 150
+ The outer \eta
  + If \eta_out < \tau, then the bow can be /radiatively confined/
  + If interacting with another stellar wind, then this is just the \eta of the other star
    + For instance, the inner proplyds in Orion that interact with \theta1 C wind
      + Mdot(-7) V3 = 4.2 \pm 1.5 ; L = 2.5e5 Lsun
      + \eta = 0.495 4.2 / 25 = 0.08 
    + The optical depth of the shell in this case is from the inner wind
      + \tau = \kappa \sigma
      + where \sigma = (3 Mdot / 16 \pi R0 Vw)
      + or for proplyd: \sigma = (3 m n0 r0^2 / 4 Ms R0)
        + where r0, n0 are radius and density at i-front
        + Ms \approx 3 is Mach number at shock
        + m is mean mass per nucleon
      + Using R0 = 1e16 R16, n0 = 1e6 n6, r0 = 1e15 r15, \kappa = 600
        + \tau = 0.033 n6 r15^2 / R16

        + So this is about 0.05 for the strongest case (167-317), which is smaller than \eta, meaning that radiative confinement does not dominate, but might be important
          + /however/, there is evidence that the 11 micron dust opacity

* On the "weak wind" problem
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       C83C750D-457C-4382-987E-C1FA8CE8FD79
:END:
+ The first order problem is that stars with luminosities < 2e5 Lsun seem to have mass loss rates much lower than predicted by simple theory (e.g, Vink)
+ Empirical papers on this include Martins:2005b and Marcolino:2009a
+ They generally find that O9.5V stars have mass loss rates around 1e-9 Msun/yr
  + This is based on H\alpha and on the UV lines
  + It is 2 orders of magnitude less than predicted
+ On the other hand, there is indication that the UV lines may underestimate the mass loss rate
  + All or most of the wind might be heated to coronal temperatures after a certain point
  + Lucy:2012a has this being due to thermal evaporation of the cool dense clumps, which cause the UV absorption in the inner regions
  + Huenemoerde:2012a present x-ray spectra of \mu Col, which is the runaway twin of AE Aur
    + They claim that mass loss rate is at least 2e-9, which is 6 times higher than derived from UV
    + Or up to 8e-9 if X-rays start at 1.5 R_* instead of R_*
      + This is preferred, since that is the radius that Cohen:2014a find that x-rays start at. 
    + X-ray widths are 300 \to 700 km/s, smaller than terminal velocity, indicating formation in the acceleration zone
    + Equation is Mdot = 3e-9 V_{1000} [(R_{\star}/R_{\odot}) EM_{54} (R_{0}/R_{\star} - b)]^{1/2}
      + where R_{0} is radius where x rays start
  + But from Cohen:2014a, in (only) one case, \zeta Oph, the mass-loss rate estimated from the x-ray lines is also small:
    + Suggests that in this case, the wind is truly weak
+ A competing theory is that X rays overionization below the critical point reduces the radiative driving and means that the mass loss rates really are low
  + [X] First proposed by Drew apparently - check
    + Drew:1994a studied x-rays from B1 B2 giants \beta and \epsilon CMa
      + Slightly cooler and slightly larger than our O9.5V stars
    + They derived mass loss rate from the x-ray EM, just like in Huenemoerde:2012a
    + Found 6 to 8e-9 Msun/yr, so very similar to what we get
      + /Although .../ if we actually use her eq (4) for \sigma Ori, then we get 1.6e-8 which is double what I derive below
    + They surmise that this is weaker than expected due to x-rays ionizing below critical point and reducing acceleration
      + Although their mass loss rates are not /that/ weak, at least as compared with the 2e-10 value
  + E.g., as also outlined in Krticka:2016b sec 6, but they conclude that for single stars this cannot change Mdot
  + See also Krticka:2015a sec 6.3, but this discussion is a bit garbled
  + More important for HMXRBs, see Krticka:2018b
    + Uses optical depth parameter: t_X = (Mdot_{-8} / V_{1000}) (1/R_{\star} - 1/D)
    + Does graphs of regimes in t_X - L_X plane
    + Our stars are right down the bottom: L_X of a few e30 erg/s
    + We are also far off to left, since t_X \approx 0.05 for Mdot = 5e-9 and R = 9 R_\odot, D = 1.5 R
    + So we are way into the region of "no effect"
  + Comments on Nebot-Gomez-Moran:2018a
    + Finds correlations between everything
    + But it makes little sense, since the strong L_x-L_bol relation swamps everything else
    + For instance they find an L_x-Mdot relation for dwarfs, but this is actually very flat
      + Which is purely a result of the L_x-L_bol being linear, but the Mdot-L_bol being steep for the dwarfs due to the weak-wind phenomenon
      + So they really need to correct for the L_x-L_bol relation before comparing with Mdot

    - So, using the Gaia PM and parallax gives
      - D = 1000 / 2.464 +/- 0.066 = 406 +/- 11 pc
    - Looking at other stars with GAIA gives consistent results for two different cuts:
      1. R < 30 arcmin and parallax = 2 \to 3 and parallax_error < 0.5
      2. R < 60 arcmin and parallax = 2.3 \to 2.6 and parallax_error < 0.3
    - Statistics are explored in
      - [[file:notebooks/GAIA%20AE%20Aur.ipynb]]
    - Both give pmra = +3 +/- 6  and pmdec = -10 +/- 7
    - So, if we take that as the motion of the ISM, then for AE Aur we get
      - pmra = -7.4
      - pmdec = 53.4
      - tangential velocity = 4.74 hypot(-7.4 +/- 6, 53.4 +/- 7) / (2.464 +/- 0.066) = 104 +/- 14
    - So this is very similar to the original value of 100



+ Comes from Trapezium, maybe
  + Originally proposed by Blaauw:1954a
    + [ ] Find this citation 
  + Hoogerwerf:2001a say there was a dynamical ejection 2.5 Myr ago, forming the runaways AE Aur and \mu Col
  + Both AE Aur and \mu Col are O9.5V with M \approx 16 \to 20 Msun and v \approx 100 km/s
  + And left behind the binary \iota Ori (O9 III + B1 III), with masses 23 + 15 = 38 Msun
    + \iota Ori has tangential velocity of 8 km/s and radial velocity of +29 km/s, very similar to the cluster
    + It is at a distance of about 5 pc to south of Trapezium, just outside the EON
    + 5 pc in 2.5 Myr is only 2 km/s, so this could be the relative transverse velocity between \iota Ori and the ONC
  + Kroupa:2018a have a bursty star cluster formation model, which they apply to Orion
    + \iota Ori was in the first generation of O stars, which subsequently got ejected
    + Seems to make sense, except their treatment of H II regions is a bit weak
  + [ ] Should think of a better model, where \iota Ori drifts away from the dense filament
    + It does mean that current Orion Nebula may be effected by the imprint of the previous episodes
+ Distance measurements vary from 380 \to 630 pc
  + Kreowski:2017a
  + If ejected from Orion 2.5 Myr ago at Vrad = (+55 km/s - 25 km/s) = 30 km/s it should now be 75 pc further away than Orion - so 485 pc

**** X-rays from AE Aur
+ Jesús is looking into this
  + I asked for
    1. Emission measure - find mass loss rate in hot component
    2. Line widths - wind velocity?
    3. f/i ratio for triplets - inner radius of hot gas
  + He has found possible variability
+ Previous work
  + Oskinova:2016a says the following:
    : X-ray observations of O-dwarfs seem to support this scenario. High-resolution X-ray spectra of ζ Oph (O9.2IV), μ Col (O9.5V), AE Aur (O9.5V), and σ Ori AB (O9.5V+B0.5V) show similar morphology (Oskinova et al., 2006; Skinner et al., 2008; Huenemoerder et al., 2012). The X-ray lu- minosity of O dwarfs is a significant frac- tion of the cool wind’s mechanical luminos- ity. For instance, the ratio between LX and Lwind = 0.5M ̇ v∞2 amounts to 0.1 in μ Col and 0.7 in AE Aur. There is only limited evi- dence for an absorption of X-rays by the cool wind component, consistent with the above picture. Analyses of line ratios of He-like ions (see Section 3) indicate that the hot matter is present already in inner wind regions where the wind velocity is low. The X-ray emission lines are broadened up to v∞, and can be well described as originating from a plasma ex- panding with a β-velocity law, i.e. the hot plasma occupies a large span of velocities.
  + *but* I have checked through those references, and none of them mention AE Aur
  + It has no detectable UV variability or magnetic field (Schnerr:2008a)
**** Images and measurements of AE Aur and IC 405 / S 126
+ I have Spitzer and WISE
+ There is no Herschel, unfortunately
  + Only field is to NE, includes some 
+ There is optical in Heggie:2008a and linked from wikipedia page

**** Papers on AE Aur
+ Hoogerwerf:2001a has the basic data and suggests origin in Trapezium region
+ Tetzlaff:2011a have better proper motions, supposedly
  + They give peculiar velocity of 148.7 +33.4/-54.6
  + They also give an age of 0.1 Myr, which cannot be right!
+ France:2007a Spitzer observations of bow shock and environs
  + Some profile cuts through the bow
  + I can use their photometry to save doing it myself
    + Except that I don't trust the 60 micron value because I think it comes from the PAH filament that crosses the bow, not the bow itself
+ Boisse:2009
  + 
+ Gratier:2014a have better CO observations
  + they think that CO globulettes are "on the parabola" - not likely!

**** Stellar wind from AE Aur
+ Martins:2005b
+ T_eff = 33 +/- 2 kK
+ log g = 4.05
+ Mdot = 3.2e-10 Msun/yr
+ V = 800 km/s
***** TODO X-rays from wind
+ Jesús is working on the observations
**** My theory for formation of IC 405
+ It is ploughing into the galactic plane
+ Recently started illuminating dense filaments
+ These photoevaporate, producing IC 405
+ Elephant trunks lag behind, point to where star used to be
+ Wind interacts with ionized gas
+ S 126 is a recombining zone that was left behind 100,000 years ago
**** Analysis of type of bow around AE Aur
+ Assume n  = 10 pcc, V = 115 km/s and L4 = 4.8
+ Then, R_* = 2.21 sqrt(L_4/n) / v_10 = 0.133 pc
  + This is 4-5 times bigger than the observed arc at 0.03 pc => x = 0.225
  + So the WBS solution requires \eta = 0.225**2 = 0.051
+ Fiducial optical depth = 0.00536 \kappa_{600}
  + Makes it very hard to be optically thick
+ Now calculate the radiation parameter \Xi
  + \Xi = L / 4 \pi R^2 c (2 n k T) = 2060
  + This is good - close to \Xi_{\dag }!
+ What is value of \eta?
  + Taking Mdot = 3.2e-10 and V = 800 gives \eta = 0.00037
  + Taking Mdot = 2e-9 and V = 1000 gives \eta = 0.002
  + Taking Mdot = 8e-9 and V = 2500 gives \eta = 0.02 - nearly there!
 
**** Geometry of the clumpy neutral filaments
+ Compare brightness between B band and PAH MIR bands, to try and diagnose position along line of sight
  + Can this actually work, or is it just going to tell me the phase function?
  + How does the AE Aur radiation field at the different filaments compare with the ISRF?
  + What other bright stars are around that might be contributing?

**** TODO The nature of the cirrus filaments
+ Mainly seen to NE of star, in cavity inside the neutral filaments
+ In the Spitzer R/G/B=24/8/4.5 image they show up with two different colours: red and lilac, which seem to alternate
  + Might this be an indication of scattering at 4.5 micron?
    + Lilac ones are in front, with forward scattering enhancing 4.5 band
    + Red ones are behind, so scattering is suppressed and dominated by thermal in 24 band
  + If so, the grains would have to be really large
    + [ ] Look up papers on core-shine/cloud-shine
      + Ysard:2016a fig 7 looks promising
        - shows significant scattering, although this is for dark clouds
        - also, fig 3 implies that g is small at 4.5 micron
      + Better: Ysard:2018a Fig 13 shows that high albedo and high g @ 4.5 \micro{}m are achieved for grains > 1 \micro{}m size for various different compositions
        - but why would we have such large grains in the H II region?
        - And where is the illumination coming from at 4.5 micron?

**** Properties of the H II regions IC 405 and S 106
+ Radius of IC 405 in upstream direction is about 5 pc
+ If it is O9.5V, then L4 = 4.8, S49 = 0.076 according to Smith:2006a (erratum)
+ So RMS density in upstream direction should be
  + n = sqrt( 3 S / 4 pi R**3 alpha) = 13 pcc
  + Could be higher near star since Ha is brighter there
*** \zeta Oph
+ Distance
  + Early works used 112 pc from Hipparcos
  + But Gaia has 172 +/- 30
+ Proper motion
  + This is also different between Hipparcos and Gaia
  + Gaia implies tangential V = 37 km/s
  + Hipparcos implies V = 15 km/s
  + For some reason, Gvaramadze:2012a have 26 km/s
+ Gvaramadze:2012a measures mass loss rate
  + 2.2e-8 from bow/hii region comparison
  + 1.58e-9 from UV analysis
  + 1.3e-7 from Vink
  + 1.4e-7 from Ha
+ Mackey:2013a do MHD simulations of H II region
  + Find that for 26.5 km/s motion, the H II region dynamics only change the density and velocity near the star at the 10% level
+ Clumps and filaments
  + There are two filaments visible in IRAF and in Akari
  + The one below (in b) looks denser, but is clearly foreground
    + Seen in extinction in H alpha
    + No bright rim
    + FIR colors look cool
    + Although 60 micron is clearly affected by illumination
  + The one above must be protruding into H II region
    + Bright in Ha - looks like photoevaporation flow from globule
    + Presumably i-front is d-type
      + Unlike r-type for the diffuse medium
    + But probably not enough time for photoevaporation flow to inflate a cavity
  + This is very similar to case of AE Aur, except the speed is lower
  + Looking at Henney:2009a, it takes about 2.5 crossing times (r_0/c_s) in order to compress the globule in an initial RDI
  + Similar time to develop a proper shock interaction with the diffuse medium
** IRS 8 and other sources in IRS 16 Northern Arm cluster
+ Geballe:2004a for IRS8 
  - bow shock visible in K band
  - R = 0.009 pc
  - Maybe O9 star

  - Moving away from galactic center
  - *What is the relation with GC sources?*
+ Tanner:2005a find a whole lot more
  - Supposedly, these are in the mini-spiral region
  - Not the same as modelled by Zajacek:2016a
  - But are same as studied by Sanchez-Bermudez:2014a
  - Thinks they are WR stars /why?/
+ Geballe:2006a
  - Find that IRS 8 is O5 to O6 giant or supergiant
+ Fisher:2007a
  - Present spectrum from 8 to 13 micron
  - Deep silicate absorption
    - This would have to be corrected for in finding SED
  - Promise more data but it has never been published
  - If we are going to analyze this, look at Shao:2018a for the IR extinction law
    - Extinction at 10 \micro{}m is same as a 2 \micro{}m
+ Sanchez-Bermudez:2014a
  - H, K, L observations
  - Some are even smaller: 500 AU = 0.0024 pc
** Galactic center bow shocks
+ Zajacek:2016a model these as winds with Mdot = 1e-8 and V = 200 km/s
  + They are supposedly T Tauri stars, which seems weird
  + Object is DSO/G2
+ All is within 0.05 pc (1e4 AU) of SMBH (M = 4e6 Msun)
  + 0.05 pc at 8 kpc is 1.3 arcsec
  + Schwarzscild radius: G M / c^2 = 2e-7 pc
+ The ambient medium is the BHs corona, which is captured from stellar winds and is in virial equilibrium
  + 
+ Sanchez-Bermudez:2014a have them being O stars or WR stars
  + Are these the same objects?
  + IRS1W, IRS5, IRS10W, and IRS21
*** Galactic center "proplyds"
+ Yusef-Zadeh:2015a detect these in radio
  + They look more like bow shocks than proplyds, although there is also some resemblance to the further out Helix knots
** TODO UCHII regions from Mac-Low:1991a
+ These have
  + R = 0.001 to 0.005 pc
  + n = 1e5 to 1e6
  + v \approx 5 km/s
  + Hard to reconcile all these with the claimed O4 to O6 spectral types, but \tau \gg 1 whatever

***** How to derive density of dust shell
+ We can estimate \tau for the shell
  + L_{neb} = L_{*} (1 - e^{-\tau}) (\Omega / 4\pi)
    + Assume (\Omega / 4\pi) = 1/2
    + \tau = -ln[ 1 - 2 L_{neb}/L_* ]
  + Absorption \tau in the UV from the MIR SED
    + L_{neb} = 155 Lsun
    + L_{*} = 2000 Lsun if B2
    + => \tau_{abs}(UV) = 0.168 /although it might be slightly higher if we have a peak around 30-40 micron/
  + Scattering \tau in the optical from the optical SED

    + Conclusion: \tau_{scat}(optical) \approx 0.3 in the optical
+ Now we can estimate the density and hence pressure in the bow shell
  + Assume shell thickness h \approx 0.2 R
  + R \approx 0.01 pc => h \approx 0.002 pc = 6.17e15 cm
  + \tau = \kappa \rho h
  + According to Hazy3 Fig 7.1, we have the following cross-sections for ISM dust
    + Scattering around 0.2 Ryd (5000 \AA): 2e-22 cm^{2}/H => \omega \kappa = 100 cm^{2}/g
    + Absorption around 1 Ryd: 1.6e-21 cm^{2}/H => (1 - \omega) \kappa = 736 cm^{2}/g
    + But this is clearly inconsistent with the observed SED
      + We have \tau_{scat}(optical) \approx \tau_{abs}(UV) (or even higher), whereas the ISM dust has it being 7 times lower
      + [ ] We should calculate the same for the Orion dust
    + For the time being, we will use the optical value as being more credible
  + So we have
    + n = \tau / m \kappa h
    + \tau = 0.3, \kappa = 100 cm^{2}/g, m = 2.17e-24 g, h = 6.17e15 cm
    + => n = 2.24e5 / \kappa_{100} cm^{-3}
    + Column is N = 1.4e21 cm^{-2} 
  + But to calculate the pressure, we need to know if it is ionized or not
  + Ionizing flux from B2 star
    + 6.3e46 s^{-1} according to Smith:2006a
    + L_{4} = 1.55
    + Ionizing flux at R = 0.01 pc is F = 5.26e12
    + ionized layer thickness is h_{i} = F / \alpha_{B} n^{2} = 4e14 cm
      + corresponding to 0.065 arcsec
    + So we have h_i \approx 0.065 h
  + Just for completeness, do flux from th1C
    + R = 0.6 pc - 60 times further away
    + S = 8e48 s^{-1} more or less - 100 times bigger
    + So F = 100/60**2 = 0.0278 times that from LP Ori itself, or 36 times smaller
  + What about H\alpha emission from inner portion?
    + Ionized density, assuming stromgren sphere with R = 0.01 pc
    + 4/3 \pi R^3 n^2 \alpha_B = S
    + n = sqrt(3 S / 4 \pi R^3 \alpha_B) = 4.4e4 pcc
    + Ionized column: 1.35e21 => \tau = 0.295 if \kappa = 100 - suprisingly high!
  + [ ] And the observed Ha brightness
    + Need to calibrate the Ha image
  + Back to the shell pressure
    + Assuming T = 1000 T_{3} K, then pressure is
    + P_{shell} = n k T = 3.12e-8 T_{3}/\kappa_{100} cgs
  + Radiation pressure is (1 - e^{-\tau}) times L / 4\pi R^{2} c
    + The \tau is the rad pressure version, averaged over spectrum, but assume 0.3
    + => (1 - e^{-\tau}) = 0.26 \approx \tau
    + P_{rad} = 1.06e-7 \tau L_{4} cgs
    + With L_{4} = 0.2 and \tau = 0.3 we get P_{rad} = 6.36e-9 cgs
      + So radiation can pressurize the shell if T < 500 K and \kappa > 200 cm^2/g
  + Photoevaporated disk wind
    + With S = 6e46 then Richling:1997a Fig 7 gives
      + Mdot = (3 - 6)e-7
      + Depending on treatment of dust scattering
    + Hollenbach:1994a have an analytic formula:
      + 1e-5 sqrt(M_{10} S_{49}) Msun/yr
      + With M_{10} = 0.7, S_{49} = 0.006, we get 6.5e-7
    + Terminal velocity is about 40 km/s
    + Hence we can calculate the wind momentum efficiency
      + \eta = Mdot V / (L/c)
      + = 3e-7 1.989e33 40 1.0e5 2.99792458e10 / 2000 3.82e33 3.15576e7 
      + = 0.298
  + *Conclusion: wind and radiation contribute equally!*

+ So this does show a gradient in f502n/f658n inside the continuum shell
  + This can't be due to continuum, so must represent a gradient in [O III]/[N II]
  + Suggests ionization front (or recombination front) before we get to the shell
+ We also use the ACS H\alpha filter, which also includes [N II]
+ And we can try and directly subtract the f547m continuum from the wfpc2 f658n filter


***** Flux calibration of the H\alpha image

+ ACS has

+ This seems too large a difference - a factor of 10 in sensitivity
+ Ah, but we have to then multiply by bandwidth
  + This is 80 \AA for ACS f658n
  + 28.3, 39.2 for WFPC2
  + Still doesn't quite work
+ Also, this is for flux/pixel so we need to divide by pixel area!
  + Now we get within a factor of two or so, which is good enough
  + [ ] Other option would be to use the Doi & O'Dell calibration
+ So H\alpha brightness is about 0.001 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + Convert to emission measure
  + S = (\alpha_{eff} / 4\pi) h\nu EM
  + \alpha_{eff} = 1e-13 cm^3/s
  + h\nu = (1/4 - 1/9) 13.6 eV = 3.026e-12 erg
  + => EM = 0.001 / (1e-13 / 4 pi) 3.026e-12 = 4.153e22 cm^-5
+ RMS electron density
  + Assume L \approx R = 0.01 pc = 3.086e16 cm
  + n = sqrt(EM / L) = 1160 cm^-3
  + That sounds like a reasonable number, but might imply a small ionizing photon luminosity
    + Q_H = (4 \pi / 3) \alpha_B n^2 R^3 = (4 pi / 3) 2.6e-13 1160**2 (0.01 3.085677582e18)**3 = 4.305e43
    + *This is very faint!*


***** Compare empirical ionized density with expectations
+ We calculate around 1000 pcc from the H\alpha surface brightness
+ What is density expected from photoevaporation flow?
  + From above we had Mdot \approx 3e-7 Msun/yr and V \approx 40 km/s
  + So at R = 0.01 pc, we should have \rho = Mdot / 4 \pi R^2 V
  + => n = \rho / m = 3e-7 1.989e33 / 4 pi 3.15576e7 (0.01 3.085677582e18)**2 40 1.0e5 1.3 1.67262158e-24 = 181.693786957
  + Really, the measurement is at about half of the bow radius, so n = 730 cm^{-3}
+ That is very close to what is observed (1000 pcc), but it is all rather puzzling
  + The H\alpha brightness does not fall as r^{-3}, as one would expect from a wind
+ There is no visible ionized shell, as would be expected on the inside of the neutral shell
+ Could it be a recombination front?

**** Is LP Ori really a bow?
+ Other possibility is that it is just an asymmetric cavity
+ On the other hand, most "cometary reflection nebulae" are rather different
  + They tend to be centered on the star

        + Mean 29832.25 +/- 3115.25
      + Net source flux: 1062976 +/- 3000 e/s = 0.214 Jy - too low!
    + Same with big circle (15 arcsec) - includes saturation spike and shell

      + Net source: 1665949 +/- 20175 e/s = 0.336 +/- 0.004 Jy
    + We need to take into account of other bleed spike, which goes off the image
      - use a snug circle and a box for the right-hand bleed spike, which we can then double
      - Snug circle (3.8 arcsec):
        - Source: 1024562
        - BG: 27785, 25810, 23921, 16258 = 23443 +/- 2521
        - Net: 1001119 +/- 2521

        - Source: 327695
        - BG: 8938, 7571, 6299, 6189 = 7249 +/- 644
        - Net: 320446 +/- 644
      - So total star is Snug circle plus two times box:
        - 1642011 +/- 2831 e/s = 0.331 Jy
        - This is 3 times higher than I had before, but is a bit smaller than the 0.5-ish that I get from the 2015 observations
      - Also shell plus other stars is Big circle minus (Snug circle plus one times box)
        - 344384 +/- 20342 = 0.069 +/- 0.004 Jy
      - Other stars from tiny circle (0.5 arcsec):
        - Stars: 8276 + 2990 + 3145
        - BG: 1291, 1359, 873, 1172, 620, 758 = 1012 +/- 124
        - Net: Stars minus three times BG = 11375 +/- 372
      - Corrected shell: 333009 +/- 20345 e/s = 0.067 +/- 0.004 Jy
        - Thus is 4.5 times higher than last time - how come?

    + Inner stars are inside the 15 arcsec source aperture, while outer stars are outside it
      + The BG values for the 15 arcsec circle avoid stars, so the inner stars need subtracting separately
    + In principle this needs an aperture correction for the 1 arcsec apertures
      + According to [[http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/analysis/ir_ee][this page]] the encircled energy is 0.92 at 1 arcsec
      + Gives total stellar flux of 0.4642/0.92 = 0.505 Jy
      + This is actually a bit less than I got before
    + For outer star 1 (source 3290 from Robberto:2013a), we can convert to magnitudes
      + 1.39 is intermediate between J and H (13/34 = 0.38 of way from 1.26 to 1.6)
      + Assume zero point of 1600 + 0.38 (1080 - 1600) = 1400 Jy
      + Magnitude is 12.66
      + Compare Robberto:2010a : J = 12.66, H = 12.07 - predict m = 12.43
      + Compare Hillenbrand:1998a : J = 12.66, H = 12.08
      + Other catalogs give J = 12.62 to 12.66
      + So, literature is maybe 0.22 mag brighter => factor of 10**(0.4 0.22) = 1.22
    + For the shell, we can approximate as 0.65678 - (0.46422 + 0.00854 + 0.00685 + 0.01315)/0.92 = 0.12 Jy
      + Compare the 0.043 that we got last time - much larger than that!
      + Why? Probably because of a bigger aperture

        + Not sure why header says something different
      + Aperture correction from Sirianni:2005a: 0.092 mag
      + So Vega magnitudes check out
      + BUT, we still haven't verified the PHOTFLAM value
        + I use the header PHOTFLAM to convert to Jy
        + Jansky zeropoint is supposedly F0 = 3640 Jy for V band
        + Magnitude = -2.5 log10(F / F0), given in JYMAG column above
      + So that checks out too
    + Final check is to find independent measurements of V magnitude of one of these stars
      + Source 3290
        + DaRio:2009a give V = 17.490, which is perfectly consistent
        + Hillenbrand:1997a give V = 17.33, which is close enough (\Delta{}m = 0.16 => 15% brighter)
        + Parihar:2009a give V = 16.28, which is a whole magnitude brighter (factor of 2.5)
  + [X] Is it anything to do with the non-standard gain?
    + Robberto used 2 e/ADU instead of 1 e/ADU, but the header says that the units are electrons, so does this matter?
    + We could use synphot to try and find out
    + Turns out that pysynphot has no "ADC gain" keywords, although other instruments, such as WFPC2, do
    + The agreement of magnitudes for the non-saturated stars, means that this cannot be an issue

+ [X] We will compare with the SED from a Cloudy model
  + For stellar SED, need to do extra foreground extinction
  + I was going to do it with pyNeb, but that only goes down to 1250 \AA
  + Other options:
    1. [X] Cloudy - I can run a special model with the star extincted by a certain column
       - This has to be done by running an actual model out to AV = 1.5, which we will try
    2. Look at getting Draine's extinction curve from somewhere
+ [X] And I also want to put on some magnitudes from the literature
  + Need to find zero points
+ [X] So now, I need to work out how I went so badly wrong with the HST photometry
  + Seems fine now

*** \theta^{1} Ori D
+ Size: about 1.5 arcsec
  + => 0.003 pc
+ Stellar data
  + From \citep{Simon-Diaz:2006b}
  + M = 18 Msun
  + L = 2.95e4 Lsun
  + T_eff = 32,000 K
  + B0.5V
+ Binarity
  + Gravity-Collaboration:2018b find two companions
    1. Close one D_3 @ 1 AU with mass 6 Msun (flux ratio 0.3)
    2. Far one D_2 @ 580 AU with mass 1 Msun
+ *Low dust opacity*: from both the Fulgencio paper and from Salgado:2016a, it seems that the FUV opacity in the ionized and neutral gas is lower than in the general ISM
  + 1.6e-22 cm^2 / H => 74 cm^2/g in PDR
  + 2e-22 cm^2 / H => 92 cm^2/g in HII region
+ But /careful/, these are absorption cross sections, /and/ they don't take into account scattering - so I think they are underestimates
+ So they say that the grain size is large, which is why there is low opacity per unit mass
  + Up to 1 micron, supposedly
  + This also explains the lowish dust temperatures of about 100 K - it would be higher for smaller grains
  + This is because the reduced grain opacity means that Lyman alpha dominates the heating over most of the nebula
    + Note that from Smith:2005a, T is > 150 K in th1D arc, and 170 K in LV1 arc
    + But, again, there might be problems.  They are taking the dust T as being equal to the color T, but it is more complicated than that, with a distribution of dust sizes
    + Also, they assume gray body with a power law dust opacity, but there is a silicate absorption feature at 11 microns - so not sure how that works
    + So this is sort of in agreement with the Cloudy models - they show T ~ 300 K for 0.1 micron grains at 0.1 pc around the 40 Msun star
+ For th1D, we have R = 0.003 pc
  + so this would correspond to about 200 K for the biggest ISM silicate grains, which is indeed higher than is observed
  + For LV1 we have about 6.5 arcsec, so (0.013 / cos i) pc, say 0.02
  + This gives T of about 200 for the 0.1 micron grains, which is a little bit higher than the 170 K observed, but not by much
  + [ ] /need to work out color temperature of Cloudy models/
  + Robberto:2005a finds that color T calculated around 11 microns is higher than that calculated at longer wavelengths
    + this is not really surprising
    + mid-IR Qabs ~ a, so that \kappa ~ a^3, so goes with mass
    + but T ~ 122 D_{17}^{-1/3} a^{-1/6} with a in micron
      + Peak b-body wavelength = 20 micron @ 100 K, or 10 micron @ 200 K
      + So this means we will see the small grains at 10 microns and the large grains at 20 microns
    + This means that 0.02 micron grains will be twice as hot
**** Shell density in Ney-Allen
+ From the Smith:2005a image, you can see a small hole in the middle, then the density seems to ramp up to the shell
+ Assuming a reasonably strong wind, with \eta = 0.1, then the ram pressure at tha inner edge is
  + \eta L / 4 \pi R^2 c
  + Assume L = 2.95e4 Lsun and R = 0.003 pc
  + = 0.1 2.95e4 3.82e33 / 4 pi 0.003**2 3.085677582e18**2 2.99792458e10
  + = 3.49e-7 cgs
  + With T = 10^4 K and P = 2 n k T, this is n = 1.26e5 cm^{-3}, which is really high
+ If we have standard dust opacity of 5e-22 then \tau = 0.02 will correspond to a thickness:
  + h = \tau / n \sigma  = 0.02 / 1e5 5e-22 = 4e14 cm = 1.3e-4 pc = 0.04 R
  + This is a bit small, but not excessively so
  + If \sigma is lower by a factor of 3 then maybe it will work

***** Subtract stellar PSF with TinyTim
+ This is getting too complicated, and might not lead anywhere

+ F547M observations

  + 12:19:16 UT
+ Turns out that focus varies between -6 and +6 microns on timescale of roughly an hour
+ There is a model for it, but only since 2003
+ So I will have to try out various values
****** Other adjustments to the PSF
****** Results for F547M
****** Results for F658N
****** Try the continuum ACS and WFC3 filters
+ I have done it for the F225W Bally observations
  + But the results are confusing
  + There are versions for both distorted and undistorted psf
    + It seems that distorted is the one to compare with the drizzled ~drz~ image
    + But I can't figure out if the orientation is right
  + So it would probably be better to go back to the original frames to do the psf subtraction
  + Discussion of alternative empirical approaches to PSF modelling [[http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/focus#3b][here]]
  + *No, using F225W is pointless* because expected position of bow is in the saturated region
+ [ ] ACS is better-modeled than WFC3 apparently
  + Do that another day
****** Another crazy idea
+ We could use th1A as a template to subtract the PSF from th1D
  + There would have to be a snall brightness scaling, but they are pretty well matched
  + Of course, this smeans that CS emission around th1A would show up as negative, but hopefully that doesn't matter - there is one proply though I think

+ 1 MJy/sr = 0.0235 mJy/arcsec^2
+ 1 arcsec^2 = 2.35043863818e-11 sr = 0.0235 nsr or nano-steradian
+ The 24.30 map is very noisy and the highest contour is possibly spurious - I am going to take the second contour, so 1.414 times less than 29500
+ In Fig 4 Hayward:1994b has I_\lambda in units of
  + erg /cm^2 /s /micron /arcsec^2
  + In CGS I_\nu = I_\lambda d\lambda/d\nu
  + d\lambda/d\nu = c / \nu^2 = \lambda^2 / c
  + I_\nu (erg /cm^2 /s /Hz /arcsec^2) = 3.336e-19n (\lambda_\micro)^2 I_\lambda (erg /cm^2 /s /cm /arcsec^2) = 3.336e-15 (\lambda_\micro)^2 I_\lambda (erg /cm^2 /s /micron /arcsec^2)
  + I_\nu (Jy/arcsec^2) = 3.336e8 (\lambda_\micro)^2 I_\lambda
  + I_\nu (GJy/sr) = 42.54 3.336e8  (\lambda_\micro)^2 I_\lambda = 1.419e10 (\lambda_\micro)^2 I_\lambda
+ Take the 10.48 micron point from Fig 4:
  + I_\lambda = 1e-10 erg /cm^2 /s /micron /arcsec^2
  + => I_\nu = 1.419 10.48**2 = 155.85 GJy/sr
  + Whereas I had 98, so need a correction factor of 1.5
  + We will apply that to all the short wavelengths, meaning effective area A = 0.788 1.5 = 1.182 nsr
+ Now the 19.62 micron point as representative of the long ones
  + I_\lambda = 1e-10 erg /cm^2 /s /micron /arcsec^2
  + => I_\nu = 1.419 19.62**2 = 546.23 GJy/sr
  + Whereas I had 436, so correction factor of 1.253
  + So use A = 0.788 1.253 = 0.987


***** Hale SpectroCam - Hayward:1994b
+ Only filter is 11.7 micron for Ney-Allen
  + They have 8.8 too, but only for the inner part around th1C
+ Flux is 228 Jy, extracted in an aperture of diameter 12 arcsec

***** IRAC
+ At the short wavelengths, the dominant background is the PSF of the star
+ I use the Smith:2005a image to define the position to take the maximum
+ Then reflect the far-side half of the PSF to give estimate of what should be subtracted
+ For 5.8, the PSF and the nebular backgrounds are roughly equal contributions
+ For 8.0, fluctuations in the nebula dominate uncertainty in the BG

+ Using the profiles from Fig 14 of Robberto:2005a, and comparing with "counts" in the FITS file ~10_wjh_hdr.fits~
  + 100 is 0.11 Jy/pix
  + 300 is 0.34 Jy/pix
  + Implying my units are mJy/pixel - hurray!
+ Pixel size is 0.26 arcsec
  + 1 Jy/pixel is 14.79 Jy/arcsec^2 = 14.79 42.54 GJy/sr = 629.2 GJy/sr
  + 1 mJy/pixel is 0.6292 GJy/sr
+ 20 micron is more problematic
  + BN/KL has peak of around 9 in my fits file ~20_hdr.fits~ and 11702 in ~10_wjh_hdr.fits~
    + From Robberto:2005a Fig 8 that should be 200 Jy/arcsec^2 at 20 micron and the same at 10 micron
    + So it would make sense if the 20 map were in Jy/pix
  + IRC4 has peak of 6 at 20 micron and 400 at 10 micron
    + So that should be 0.4 14.79 = 5.9 Jy/arcsec^2 at 10 micron
      + Given as 4.76 in Table 4 - close enough!
    + And should be 6 14.79 = 88.74 at 20 micron
      + Given as 101 in Table 4 - again close enough
  + So we just multiply all ~20_hdr.fits~ by 1000 to get them in mJy/pix
+ Filter widths
  : For an A0 V star, the N-band filter has an effective wavelength \lambda_{10} =  10.1 \micro{}m and \Delta\lambda = 3.13 \micro{}m, whereas the Q-band filter has \lambda_{20} = 19.7 \micro{}m and \Delta\lambda = 2.44 \micro{}m.

+ Doing Epandas ellipse photometry at 10.1 microns
  + Total flux: (96141.966 + 77094.644)/1000 = 173.2 Jy
    + That is very close to the T-ReCS value at 11.7, but the BG values are very different
    + Area 1052 pixels = 74.83 arcsec^2
      + I don't understand why this is slightly smaller area than with T-ReCS, given that I copied the region over - but never mind
  + Box for BG, same as T-ReCS:
    + 1.499 +/- 6% Jy/arcsec^2
    + 112 Jy in the Epandas aperture, which is enormous
    + The problem here is that there is a glow underneath the MAX observations, and this BG box is right on its maximum - need to find a region that is more representative of the glow underneath th1D
      + This gives me 1.085 +/- 5% Jy/arcsec^2
      + Or 81.2 Jy in aperture, which seems about right, but I would put up the error to +/- 10
  + So BG-subtracted flux is
    + 173.2 - (81.2 +/- 10) = 92. +/- 10 Jy
  + Matching that to the peak-intensity derived fluxes, then implies an effective area of 92./131.5 = 0.70 nsr, which is like what we had anyway
+ Repeat but for 19.7 micron
  + Total flux: 263.30496 + 272.37955 = 535.68 Jy
  + BG box: 4.96 Jy/arcsec^2 +/- 3%
    + 371 +/- 11 Jy in source aperture
  + BG-subtracted flux is
    + 535.68 - (371 +/- 11) = 164.68 +/- 11
  + Matching to peak-intensity derived fluxes:
    + effective area of 165/166.1 = 0.99 nsr,

+ This is probably an overestimate compared with the others because the resolution is much higher, so the peak surface brightness is higher
+ We will also do the flux in a proper aperture
  + Use an Epandas ellipse and take front two sectors
    + Total flux: 87.49 + 72.08 = 160 +/- 18 Jy 
    + Area: 40000 pixels or 79.35 arcsec^2
    + Average surface brightness: 2.0 +/- 0.23 Jy/arcsec^2 = 85.1 +/- 9.8 GJy/sr, which is half of the peak value
  + Use sector 4 as BG  /cancelled/ :
    + Total flux: 14.33 Jy
    + Area: 1848 pixels or 16.135 arcsec^2
    + Surface brightness: 0.888 +/- 0.235 Jy/arcsec^2 = 37.78 +/- 10.00 GJy/sr
      + That is a bit higher than we were using, which we measured in front
  + Taking a box instead I get:
    + 0.41 +/- 0.12 Jy/arcsec^2 for BG = 17.4 +/- 5.1 GJy/sr
    + Let's go with that
    + It is 32.5335 +/- 9.522 Jy in the source apertures 
  + So then BG-subtracted flux is
    + (160 +/- 18) - 79.35 (0.41 +/- 0.12) = 127 +/- 20
  + If we wanted to match that to the intensity-derived fluxes, then it would require an effective area of 127/161.1 = 0.788 nsr
    + *but* the other measurements are lower resolution, so need to check on the UKIRT data

***** Converting to F_{\nu}, \nu F_{\nu}, \nu L_{\nu}, and \nu I_{\nu}
+ Radius of peak is about 3 arcsec, so that would give an area of
  + 28.3 arcsec^2
  + 0.665 nsr (nano-steradians)
  + Convenient, since multiply by GJy/sr to get Jy
  + Although we now use a column ~A~ to specify the effective area, which varies slightly between instruments
+ Using that would mean T-RecS gives 104.65 Jy
  + Compare with 228 Jy from Hale at same wavelength 
+ To get the SED, we have to multiply by \nu
  + \nu = c / \lambda = 2.9979e14 / \lambda(micron)
  + 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg/cm^2/s/Hz
  + So SED in erg/cm^2/s is 2.9979e-9 times F_\nu(Jy) / \lambda(micron)
+ To get luminosity, multiply by 4\pi D^2
  + For Orion: 2.011e43 to give erg/s
  + Or 5.2652e9 to give L_\odot
+ Or, we can just convert to intensity SED \nu I_{\nu}, as in Salgado:2016a Fig 6
  + Same as flux calculation
  + \nu I_\nu (erg/s/cm^2/sr) =  2.9979 I_\nu(GJy/sr) / \lambda(micron)
+ E.g., T-ReCS value @ 11.7 micron of 161.1 GJy/sr
  + \nu I_\nu = 41.3 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + with A = 0.788 nsr: F_\nu = 127 Jy
  + \nu F_\nu = 3.254e-8 erg/s/cm^2
  + with D = 410 pc: \nu L_\nu = 171.3 L_\odot
+ Another way of looking at it is that \nu I_\nu in erg/s/cm2/sr is about 5 times less than \nu L_\nu in Lsun

+ Column ~A~ is the effective area in nano-steradians.  This is what we multiply the peak surface brightness by to get the total flux.  See discussion above in [[id:A56D8FCA-B3E1-4ACC-A973-4838DB208748][Gemini T-ReCS - Smith:2005a]] and [[id:CEC2E640-8DFC-4CE8-AE69-513510017BE1][UKIRT MAX - Robberto:2005a]] sections
+ Column ~Use~ is whether or not to use the point in integrating the SED
+ Eliminated points, because the errors are too large

+ Comments on the SED:
  1. Agreement is very good around 10 micron, three different instruments give F_\nu \approx 100 Jy, with the exception of Hale SpectroCam, which is about 200 Jy
  2. At 20 microns, there is much more disagreement, by a factor of 4
  3. The Sofia points are systematically low
  4. SED integrates to 310 Lsun
  5. If we use L_* = 2.95e4 Lsun, then we get \tau = 2 L_IR / L_* = 0.02
     - This is distressingly low!

****** IUE Near/Far UV spectra of th1D
+ From [[http://sdc.cab.inta-csic.es/ines/Overview.html][ESA INES]] (IUE Newly-Extracted Spectra)
  + Requested acknowledgement
    : "Based on INES data from the IUE satellite"
+ See [[id:E0F46F48-97C4-4E3F-9C4C-0813A6EB034D][IUE near UV from Valenti:2003a and far UV from Valenti:2000a]] for corresponding data on LP Ori
+ There are lots of spectra, both SWP and LWP, but some have obvious problems:
  + SWP10007RS.FITS - ten times lower than others - don't know why
  + SWP14668RL.FITS - 3-4 times higher than others, probably because it is with the large aperture (10 x 20 arcsec), which is bound to include other Trapezium stars
+ Ones that look more reliable
  + SWP49013RS.FITS - good for 1200 \to 2000 \AA range.  Gives F_{\lambda} around 3e-11 at 2000 \AA
  + LWP26622RS.FITS and LWP26623RS.FITS - good for the 2000 \to 3200 \AA range.  Also gives F_{\lambda} around 3e-11 at 2000 \AA
+ *BUT* there are others that give higher fluxes
  + SWP04986 has large and small apertures
    + difference is a factor of 2.11 at 1300 \AA or factor of 1.64 at 1950 \AA
    + Which implies it may partly due to the large aperture letting in some of th1c's light
  + But even the small aperture has 30e-11 at 1920 \AA, which is 10 times what SWP49013 gives
+ *CONCLUSION* Use the spectra from Bohlin:1981a, which were done with the large aperture

+ Re-check conversion:
  + F_\nu = d\lambda/d\nu = F_\lambda / d\nu/d\lambda = (\lambda^2 / c) F_\lambda

***** Audit of th1D fluxes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       984E8E7C-D0BE-4F56-B4CB-F904211433F1
:END:
+ At the momemt, we have two problems
  1. Observed SED is much lower than extinguished model SED in optical/UV
     - Maybe partly due to a higher AV than I have used (1.5) - Simon-Diaz:2006a have 1.79, based on Preibisch:1999a
     - Who in turn cite Hillenbrand:1997a
       - Parenago 1889
       - Derives A_V from V versus (I - V) color-magnitude diagram, as compared with inrtinsic colors
     - And Brown:1994a
       - [[http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/A%252bA/289/101/table1d][Vizier link to table]]
       - Gives smaller values of A_V
       - E.g., 1.06 for th1D
  2. [X] UV SED is lower than U-band magnitude suggests
     - This is now sorted by using the Bohlin:1981a measurements
+ Using a larger extinction
  + If we believe R_V = 5.5, then the E(B-V) = 0.36 implies A_V = 2
  + This comes from B-V = +0.08, which Bohlin:1981a give
  + This is consistent with Morell:1978a
  + If we use Hoffleit:1991a for B and Hillenbrand:1997a for V we get +0.09, which is the same within the errors, which are of order 0.05
  + So, if we use R_V = 5.5 +/- 0.5 and E(B-V) = 0.36 +/- 0.05, then A_V = 1.98 +/- 0.33


****** Audit of V-band magnitude, flux, luminosity
+ Everyone agrees V = 6.70 +/- 0.01
+ Absolute magnitude
  + with D = 410 +/- 10 pc, then DM = 5 log10(D) - 5 = 8.06 +/- 0.05
  + So M_V = 6.70 +/- 0.01 - 8.06 +/- 0.05 = -1.36 +/- 0.05
  + Simon-Diaz:2006a give M_V = -3.3 +/- 0.3 because they have used D = 450 pc => DM = 8.27 and they have compensated for A_V = 1.79
    + M_V = 6.70 - 8.27 - 1.79 = -3.36
  + Using D = 410, and A_V = 1.98 +/- 0.33, I would get M_V = 6.7 +/- 0.01 - 8.06 +/- 0.05 - 1.98 +/- 0.33 = -3.34 +/- 0.33
    + Almost exactly the same!
+ Bolometric correction and total luminosity
  + Simon-Diaz:2006a give
    + T_eff = 32,000 K
    + log g = 4.2
  + Nieva:2013a give BC = 21.00 - 5.3 log10(T_eff) +/- 0.01
    + BC = -2.88 +/- 0.01
    + M_bol = -3.34 - 2.88 = -6.24 +/- 0.33
    + Note that the error budget is completely dominated by the uncertainty in R_V
  + Taking M_bol,sun = 4.75 from Casagrande:2014a, we then have
    + L/Lsun = 10**(0.4 (4.75 - M_bol)) = (2.49 +/- 0.76) \times 10^{4}
    + This is a little bit smaller than the L_4 = 2.95 that we had been using
+ Stellar radius and mass
  + Radius: Using T_sun = 5777 K, we get R/Rsun = sqrt((2.49 +/- 0.76) 1e4 5777**4 / (3.2e4 +/- 1000)**4) = 5.14 +/- 0.85
  + Mass: g = G M / R^2 => M = R^2 g / G = 15 +/- 5 Msun
  + Compare with M_spec = 18 +/- 6 Msun from Simon-Diaz:2006a
    + They derive M_evol = 16, so our new value is actually closer
  + Also (T, log g) is pretty close to the 15 Msun ZAMS shown in Fig 1 of Nieva:2013a
  + So everything makes sense, more or less
    + M = 15 Msun
    + L = 2.5e4 Lsun
    + T = 32,000 K
    + A_V = 2

***** Possible line contamination 
+ Br\alpha at 4.5 \micro

***** Modeling the SED
+ [X] Need to run some Cloudy models
+ Comparison with Hayward:1994a two component models
  1. T = 358 K, \tau = 1.22e-4
  2. T = 117 K, \tau = 0.154
+ Note that Hayward did not have the longer wavelengths, so didn't need a very cold component
+ Comparison with Salgado:2016a models (at th1D position)
  1. T = 40 K, \tau = 0.1
  2. T = 110 K, \tau = 0.002
+ Note that Salgado doesn't have the 10 micron wavelengths, so doesn't need the hot component!
***** Comparison of luminosities
+ We have total Ney-Allen luminosity of 308.6 Lsun
+ Salgado:2016a have total luminosity of Orion Bar as 9500 Lsun
  + Check that I understand their map in Fig 9 correctly
    + 15 red pixels @ 40 = 600 Lsun
    + 29 purple pixels @ 30 = 870 Lsun
    + 28 blue pixels @ 20 = 560 Lsun
    + Sums to 2030 Lsun
+ Total IR luminosity of Trapezium region and Orion S
  + I can't find any actual calculations of this, but I will try and estimate from 
*** Extinction curves for Orion stars 
+ This all comes from IUE observations, mainly in Fitzpatrick:2007a
  + But see also earlier work in Fitzpatrick:1990a, which includes \theta^{1} D
+ Relevant figures:
  + [[file:extinction-curves/fg4_8.h.jpg]]
  + [[file:extinction-curves/fg4_9.h.jpg]]
+ There are several Orion stars:
  + HD36982 - LP Ori
  + HD37020 - \theta^{1} A - B0.5
  + HD37022 - \theta^{1} C - O7
  + HD37023 - \theta^{1} D - B0.5 /not included in 2007 paper/
  + HD37061 - NU Ori - B0.5
  + HD294264 - V2239 Ori - B3 
  + Other, later B stars
+ Also some Carina stars from Tr16 in Fig 4.16
+ General properties of the Orion curves
  + All are similar in that they have high R_V and almost completely flat FUV curves
  + Most have very weak 2000 \AA bump, but LP Ori's is more normal
  + The graphs are all normalized by E(B - V), but if we normalize by A(1\micro{}m), as in lower panel of Fig 8, then things are clearer
    + Extinction hardly varies from 5000 down to 1200 \AA, and is about 2 to 3 times the 1 micron value
    + This is very different from general ISM, where extinction at 1200 \AA is 10 to 20 times the 1 micron value 
+ The Carina stars
  + These tend to have R_V = 3 to 4 and UV slopes that are steeper than Orion but less so than average ISM

Note (1): The stars are listed in order of increasing Right Ascension using the
          most commonly adopted forms of their names. The first preference was 
          ``HDnnn'', followed by ``BDnnn'', etc.  There are 185 survey stars 
          which are members of open clusters or associations.  The identity of 
          the cluster or association is either contained in the star name 
          itself (e.g., NGC 457 Pesch 34) or is given in parentheses after the 
          star's name. 
Note (2): Spectral types were selected from those given in the SIMBAD database,
          and the source of the adopted types is shown in the ``Ref''.  When 
          multiple types were available for a particular star, we selected one 
          based on our own preferred ranking of the sources. 
Note (3): The NGC 2244 distance is from Perez et al. (1987); the NGC 3293 
          distance is from Bolona & Crampton (1974); the Trumpler 14 and 16 
          distances are from Massey & Johnson (1993); the Cep OB3 distance is 
          from  Crawford & Barnes (1970).  The distances to all other clusters 
          or associations are from the Open Clusters and Galactic Structure 
          database maintained by Wilton S. Dias, Jacques Lepine, Bruno S. 
          Alessi, and Andre Moitinho at http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~wilton/.  
          For the non-cluster stars, distances were calculated using the 
          E(B-V) values from this study and the absolute magnitudes from 
          Turner (1980) (for mid-B and earlier types) and Blaauw (1963) 
          (for mid-B and later types).

Note (1): The stars are listed in order of increasing Right Ascension using the
          most commonly adopted forms of their names. The first preference was
          ``HDnnn'', followed by ``BDnnn'', etc.  There are 185 survey stars
          which are members of open clusters or associations.  The identity of
          the cluster or association is either contained in the star name
          itself (e.g., NGC 457 Pesch 34) or is given in parentheses after the
          star's name.
Note (2): For the O stars analyzed using the TLUSTY atmosphere models, the 
          values of Teff were adopted from the Spectral Type vs. T_eff_ 
          relation given in Table 2.  These stars can be identified by their 
          1-{sigma} uncertainties, which are {+/-}1000 K. 
Note (3): For stars in clusters, the surface gravities are determined as 
          discussed in S 3.1 and rely on stellar evolution models and cluster 
          distance determinations.  Surface gravities for non-cluster stars are
          not always well-determined, because of a lack of specific 
          spectroscopic indicators.  In some cases, the best-fit solutions for 
          these stars indicated physically unlikely results 
          (i.e., log(g) > ~4.3 or log(g) < ~3.0).  For these stars, a value of 
          log(g) = 3.9 was assumed (which is the mean log(g) of the rest of the
          sample) and a 1-{sigma} uncertainty of {+/-}0.2 was incorporated in 
          the error analysis.  These cases can be identified by log(g) entries 
          of ``3.9{+/-}0.2.''.
Note (4): For the O stars in the sample, our fitting procedure utilized solar 
          abundance TLUSTY models.  For these stars the values of [m/H] are 
          indicated by entries of ``0'' without uncertainties. 
Note (5): For the O stars, the adopted TLUSTY models incorporate 
          Vturb = 10 km/s.  For these stars the values of Vturb are indicated 
          by entries of ``10'' without uncertainties.  For the B stars, which 
          were modeled using ATLAS9 models, the values of Vturb were determined
          by the fitting procedure, but were constrained to lie between 0 and 
          10 km/s. Stars whose best-fit SED models required these limiting 
          values are indicated by Vturb entries of ``0'' or ``10'', without 
          error bars. The uncertainties for stars with best-fit Vturb values 
          close to these limits may be underestimated due to this truncation.

Note (1): The stars are listed in order of increasing Right Ascension using the
          most commonly adopted forms of their names. The first preference was
          ``HDnnn'', followed by ``BDnnn'', etc.  There are 185 survey stars
          which are members of open clusters or associations.  The identity of
          the cluster or association is either contained in the star name
          itself (e.g., NGC 457 Pesch 34) or is given in parentheses after the
          star's name.
Note (2): For the stars HD237019, HD18352, and HD25443 the long wavelength IUE 
          spectra are incomplete.  For these cases we constrained the UV linear
          extinction component to follow the relation c1 = 2.18 - 2.91*c2 from 
          Fitzpatrick (2004).  For these stars we list uncertainties for the 
          c2 values but not for the c1 values. 
Note (3): The uncertainties in the O2 and O3 optical spline points (at 
          wavelengths of 4000 and 5530 Angstroms, respectively) are tyically 
          0.01 or less and are not listed.  For several stars, those without U 
          band photometry, we did not solve for the O1 point at 3300 Angstroms.
Note (4): For field stars without IR photometry, we assumed R(V) = 3.1 and 
          kIR = 1.11, with the latter based on the relation 
          kIR = 0.63*R(V) - 0.84 from Fitzpatrick (2004).  For such stars in 
          clusters, we adopted the mean R(V) of the other cluster members and a
          value of kIR based on the aforementioned relation.  These assumed 
          values are listed in the Table without uncertainties.  Several survey
          stars have apparently noisy JHK data and yielded very uncertain 
          values of kIR.  For these, we ultimately derived the extinction curve
          by solving for the best-fit value of R(V) with kIR constrained to 
          follow the Fitzpatrick (2004) relation.  The resultant R(V) values 
          are listed with their uncertainties while the kIR values are listed 
          without uncertainties.

**** Other papers on dust in Orion
+ McCall:1981a
  + First to propose big grains in Orion, based on wavelength of max polarization
  + Some models - concluded that size-dependent separation not important
+ Sorrel:1992a
  + Has a model of mainly silicates, porous, up to 0.13 micron
  + Says shocks unimportant (by which he means slow shocks that shatter large grains)
  + /author does nor believe in cosmological redshift!/
+ Cardelli:1988a
  + Derives optical/uv extinction curves - R_V = 5.5 or so
+ Da-Rio:2010a
  + Derives R_V = 3 from (B-V) - (V-I) color-color diagrams for PMS stars in Orion
  + Impossible to explain the reddest (B - V) colors if R_V = 5
  + *BUT* this mainly applies to stars with A_V > 1.5, so that is either circumstellar extinction or from the background cloud
+ Hasenberger:2016a
**** Deriving the extinction curves of the Cloudy models
+ Two ways of looking at it:
  1. Just divide the incident by the transmitted continuum
     - This is easiest, since I already have the machinery
     - But it is a combination of gas and dust opacity
  2. Use the info in the ~XXX.opc~ files
     - This has cross-section per H for each size bin
     - Disadavantage is that there is a lot of other info in the file before it
     - Probably best to do a pre-processing step that trips out just the cross-section data
+ We will try both approaches, starting with the first
+ *CONCLUSIONS*
  1. The "triple" dust mixture gives a very flat extinction curve from IR to UV
  2. Cloudy's "orion" dust has R_V = 4.5 and is missing the 2175 \AA bump
  3. Cloudy's "ism" dust has R_V = 3.7 and dose have the 0.2175 micron bump

***** Effects of PAH on extinction
+ Li:2001a Fig 16 shows that PAH is negligible contribution to opacity in mid-infrared, but does contribute to C peaks at 2000 and 1000 \AA 


** Ones in Ochsendorf papers

*** \sigma Ori
+ Coordinates:
  + Equatorial: 05h38m42s -02d36m00s
  + Galactic: 206.81067369 -17.34616728
+ Ochsendorf:2014b, Ochsendorf:2015a
+ Stellar parameters (from them)
  + binary O9.5V + B0.5V
  + L4 = 6.02, so like the 20 Msun case
  + \eta = 0.0697 or 0.0002 - they prefer the second
    + [ ] They cite Najarro et al 2011 - need to check it out
+ Star may be moving at 15 km/s to NW
+ Distance may be less than M42
  + Bally:2018a have a discussion where they finally adopt 360 pc
  + But Kounkel:2018a have it in a new grouping called Orion C
    + 3 epochs of star formation from 10 to 2 Myr ago, correspond to 3 sub-clusters:
      1. Ori C-North with age of 7.5 Myr
      2. Ori C-Central with age of 5.5 Myr
      3. \sigma Ori with age of 1.9 +/- 1.6 Myr
    + with distance 412 +/- 4 pc for whole lot, or 406 +/- 4pc for \sigma Ori
    + This is similar to Orion B (containing Horsehead Nebula), which has distance 407 +/- 4 pc
    + But they have different radial velocities:
      + about V_LSR = 10 km/s for Orion B
      + about V_LSR = 13 km/s for Orion C
      + So 2 Myr ago, \sigma Ori was 6 pc in front of Orion B
    + Tangential velocities:
      + 2 mas/yr in RA to E and 3 mas/yr in Dec to N seems typical of \sigma Ori sub cluster, from Fig 14.2
      + 1 mas/yr = 2 km/s => total speed is about 7 km/s to NW
      + But what is speed of L1630 Cloud?
+ To get a dust wave, we need that \eta is small or V is large
  + V large is definitely ruled out
    + Star has V = 15 km/s (maybe)
    + Isothermal photoevaporation flow has
      + M_{1} / M_{0} = sqrt(1 + 2 ln(\rho_{0} / \rho_{1}))
      + They say \rho_{1} = 10, \rho_{0} = 100 pcc, so M_{1} = 2.37 M_{0}
      + So with M_{0} = 1 and c_{s} = 11 km/s \Rightarrow V = 26 km/s
  + So how small does \eta need to be?
    + v_10 > sqrt(\Xi_{\dag }\eta)
    + so we need \Xi_{\dag }\eta < 9 where \Xi_{\dag }\approx 3000 for O stars
    + \eta < 0.003
+ In IC 434 H II region
  + Photoevaporation flow has supposedly fallen from 100 pcc at i-front to 10 pcc
+ Fiducial radius
  + R_* = 2.21 sqrt(L4/n) / v10
  + = 0.7 pc
+ Bow shock radius - if it were a bow shock
  + R_0 = sqrt(\eta) R_*
  + => \eta = (0.1 / 0.7)**2 = 0.02 
+ Rip point radius
  + R_\dag = v10 R_* / sqrt(\Xi) = 1.7 / sqrt(\Xi)
  + So \Xi = 300 required to match observations of 0.1 pc
  + Unless arc radius is not the rip point
+ Observed arc radii
  + R = 0.1 pc for inner dust wave (dust T about 70 K)
  + R = 1 pc for outer dust wave, which may or may not exist (dust T about 20 K)



**** Structure of IC 434
+ To the W we have the Orion B cloud, which is supposedly photoevaporating
  + 0.58 degrees away => 4.15 pc
  + Peak brightness is about 7000 in SHASSA
+ To the E it peters out, with maybe a little limb brightening
  + 0.8 degrees away => 5.7 pc
  + Peak brightness about 1500 in SHASSA
+ In the middle, the brightness is about 1500 too (1000 to N, 2000 to S)
  + So, if LOS depth is the same, then density has dropped by factor of only 2
  + But it is probably more than that - in the Horsehead, the density is supposed to be about 100 pcc, but in a thin layer only
  + Up above I have density going from 100 \to 10, implying Mach number M = 2.4
  + If we really have as low a T = 6000 K, then sound speed may be 8.5 so v = 20 km/s is about right (ignoring proper motion)
+ This is hard to reconcile with being ionization bounded on both sides
  + More likely to be matter-bounded to the West
  + This also explains why there are ionized globules further out associated with the neutral shell GS206-17+13
    + Which is more like a collection of filaments
    + Distances up to about 1.6 deg => 11.5 pc
  + So what is confining the region to the W?
    1. Perhaps no confinement, still expanding.  With 10 km/s speed and edge-to-edge distance of 10 pc, it would take 1 Myr to cross
    2. Photoevaporation flows from the globules - this is a bit hard to believe, but it is possible
    3. Magnetic pressure - maybe
    4. Hot gas - seems unlikely, but you never know


**** Momentum balance at the inner shell
+ Inner radius of shell is 60 arcsec => 0.12 pc
+ Luminosity is about L_4 = 6
+ If n = 10 pcc and V = 20 km/s
  + => R_* = 2.21 sqrt(L_4/n) / v_10 = *0.856 pc*
  + => \tau_* = 0.0089 \kappa_600 sqrt(L_4 n) / v_10 = *0.035* if \kappa = 600 cm^2 / g
+ This means that x = 0.12
  + WBS: x = sqrt(\eta) which would need \eta = 0.0144
  + RBW: x = 2 \tau_* which requires \tau_* = 0.06 or \kappa = 1000 cm^2/g (\kappa_{600} = 1.67)
    + or \sigma = \kappa m = 2e-21 cm^2 / H
+ Note \tau = 2 x \tau_* = 0.0084 \kappa_{600}
  + Which means that L_{IR} / L_{*} \approx 0.5 \tau \approx 4.2e-3 \kappa_{600}
  + Or L_{IR} \approx 421 L_{\odot} if we are in RBW regime
  + Could be smaller if \kappa_{600} < 1.67, in which case we need the wind with \eta = 0.0144
+ What if the speed were higher, say 40 km/s?
  + Both R_* and \tau_* scale as 1/v, so they would be 0.428 pc and 0.0175 \kappa_{600} respectively
  + So x = 0.24, which would require a stronger wind in the WBS regime
  + But \tau is unaffected


**** Infrared SED of inner shell
+ Ochsendorf:2015a Fig 4e shows the SED
  + But it is I_\nu in MJy/sr, whereas we want to convert it to L_\odot
+ Half power contour is roughly 60 x 180 arcsec (diameters)
  + Area of pi 60 180 / 4 = 8480 square arcsec = 200 nsr (nanosteradian) = 0.2 msr (millisteradian)
+ So multiply I_\nu in MJy/sr by \Omega in msr to get F_\nu in Jy
+ To get SED in erg/cm^2/s, it is 2.9979e-9 F_\nu(Jy) / \lambda(micron)
+ For luminosity, multiply by 4 \pi D^2 = 2.011e43 @ 410 pc
  + Or 5.2652e9 to give L_\odot
+ So, to get \nu L_\nu SED in L_\odot it is 15.78 I_\nu \Omega / \lambda 
+ Now include the measured SEDs, subtracting the region 4 values

#+TBLFM: $4=15.78 0.2 ($2 - $3) / $1 ;f1
+ Note that 12, 14, 20 points are from the region 7 spectra but multiplied by 4
  + Since we have no mid-IR spectra for the IDW aperture
+ So, not looking good for RBW!
  + We need 400 Lsun, looks like we get about 15 Lsun
+ Do my own measurements from the MIPS and IRAC maps (already in MJy/sr)
  + MIPS 23.68 micron
    + Median zodiacal light is 23.31573
    + Lowest level is about 30, so zodiacal dominates there, but it doesn't matter since we are always subtracting the BG anyway
    + Peak brightness method
      + Peak is 120, mean BG is 32, so 120 - 32 = 88
      + So half power contour at 32 + 44 = 76
      + This makes almost no difference to the measured size, so still 0.2 msr
      + But with the higher peak we now get 15.78 0.2 88 / 23.68 = 11.7 Lsun

      - Each pixel is 2.45 arcsec => 1.41e-4 msr
      - So this gives a shell luminosity of 288.54 - 244.05 - 9.59 = 34.9 Lsun
      - Three times bigger than the peak brightness method, but is including dust that has not been decelerated yet
      - Taking tighter boxes gives 60.80 - 34.76 - 9.59 = 16.45 which is much closer
      - Tight box is 1.46 msr (4 arcmin) and wide box is 10.8 msr (11 arcmin)
  + IRAC 8 micron (actually 7.872)
    + Peak brightness method
      + Peak is 8 (excluding apparent jet)
        + This is actually hard to measure - may be overestimated - more like 7.4 immediately to E of star
      + Mean BG is 6.4 => half power contour = 7.2
      + Net peak is 8 - 6.4 = 1.6
      + SED is 15.78 0.2 1.6 / 7.872 = 0.64 Lsun
      + So far below the 24 micron value
    + No point to flux method here, since it will be too hard to subtract out the stars and jets and the like
  + Other IRAC bands are negligible
+ Do my own measurements with the WISE 
    

**** TODO [#A] More SEDS
+ [2019-01-29 Tue] *Still to do*
  + Measure SED of inner arc in more wavelengths: IRAC, WISE, Herschel, Akari, MSX (unique in providing 14 micron, but noisy)
  + Measure SED of outer arc too, and of NS filament, and of general background
**** \sigma Ori proplyd
+ \sigma Ori IRS1 B
+ See Hodapp:2009a and van-Loon:2003a
+ This is very close to the Aa/Ab/B triple
  + 3.5 arcsec in projection => 2e16 cm = 0.007 pc (20 times smaller than inner radius of inner arc)
+ I-front radius is about 40 mas = 2.45e14 cm = 16 AU *very small*
+ Ha emission
  - Hodapp:2009a measure it as 4.7 e−15 W/m^2 = 4.7e-12 erg/cm^2/s
    - Ha energy is 13.6 (1/4 - 1/9) eV = 3.026e-12 erg
    - F = 1.55 phot/cm^2/s
  - We can convert this into an VEM, n^2 h R^2, assuming no extinction
    - Assuming F = pi \alpha_eff \omega R^3 n^2 / 4 pi D^2
    - With \omega = 0.1 and \alpha_eff = 1e-13
    - => n = 2 D sqrt(F / \alpha_eff \omega R^3) = 8.2e6 pcc
  - Or compare with Odell:1998a values for Orion proplyds
    - The distance is the same 410 pc within the errors, so no correction there
    - I /think/ that the fluxes in Bob's Table 1 are extinction corrected, but I am not entirely sure
      - *Update* Now, I think they are not - so should be multiplied by about 2.6 to 3.6, for C(Hb) in range 0.6 to 0.8
    - These are very comparable
    - Proplyds with separations 7 to 30 arcsec have fluxes of 0.5 to 3 phot/cm^2/s
      - *Extinction correction* gives 1.5 to 12 phot/cm^2/s
  - Best match might be for LV4 (161-324)
    - from [[id:4F6EA6F7-1F1D-4EF6-BEAC-13D83C905301][NUV observations of LV4]] in [[file:~/Work/Bowshocks/Jorge/bowshock-shape/new-HST-shapes/new-hst-shapes.org][new-hst-shapes.org]] we find a radius of 0.02 arcsec or 8.6 AU, based on the FOC F235M observations in Bally:1998a Fig 8 (mislabeled as 161-322)
    - This is exceedingly small - in Henney:1998b we gave 3.5e14 cm = 23 au as the size
    - projected separation of LV 4 is 6 arcsec, so F is down by a factor of 4 compared with IRS1B, *but* ionizing flux is larger
+ Radio observations Drake:1990a
  + At the time, they thought it was from the star and was non-thermal
  + But part or all might be thermal
  + about 1 to 2 mJy at both 2 and 6 cm, falling to about 1 mJy at 20 cm
  + They also find 3 additional 6 cm sources, with fluxes of 3 to 9 mJy
  + Equivalent values for some Orion proplyds (Henney:2001b):
    - 161-324: 5 mJy and F(Ha) = 3 (Bob says 1.1)
    - 167-317: 30 mJy, but this has F(Ha) = 13 phot/cm^2/s apparently, even though Bob says only 3 - strange, but maybe Bob's values are not extinction corrected 
+ Theoretical scalings of flux, brightness, mass loss rate as functions of ionizing flux F and ionization front size r
  + For recombination dominated flow: S(Ha) \propto F \propto n^2 r
  + Ha flux has additional scaling with area: F(Ha) \propto r^2 F \propto n^2 r^3 
  + Mass loss rate Mdot \propto n r^2 \propto sqrt(F(Ha) r)
  + If r is fixed, then Mdot \propto n \propto sqrt(F) \propto 1/D where D is separation
    + But that only applies if EUV-controlled
    + If FUV controlled, then r n(PDR) = constant and Mdot \propto sqrt(T(PDR))
+ Deduced Mdot for IRS1B
  + Highest values for proplyds is 1e-6 Msun/yr with scaling as sqrt(FHa r)
  + Or theoretical scaling as (n r^2)
    + 161-324 has r15^2 n6 = 0.54
    + 167-317 has r15^2 n6 = 2.56
    + 177-341 has r15^2 n6 = 2.48
    + 182-413 has r15^2 n6 = 2.08
  + So 161-324 is 4 to 5 times smaller Mdot probably
  + Extra sqrt(2) for smaller flux means that IRS1B should be 5.65 times smaller
    + => about 2e-7 Msun/year
  + Alternatively, use the density of 8.2e6 derived above
    + Use 2 pi instead of 4 pi to account for anisotropy
    + Mdot = 2 pi m n r^2 c = 1.17e-7 Msun/yr
    + So that is only half as big
+ Isotropy of flow
  + Henney:1999a find roughly equal mass loss contributions from head and tail for 177-341
  + Also expected on theoretical grounds if neutral wind from disk is relatively insensitive to FUV flux
  + [ ] Need to work out how the anisotropy gets smoothed out with radius
+ Terminal velocity
  + For a strictly isothermal flow, the asymptotic behavior is v \propto sqrt(ln r)
  + I-front radius 2.45e14 cm expands out to bow radius of 0.1 pc = 3.085677582e17, which is factor of 1000!
    + More exactly, from Dyson:1968a we have

    + In other words, we can get up to M = 5.7, or v = 65 km/s if c = 11.5 km/s
  + However, more likely we reach a terminal velocity when expansion cooling starts to compete with photoionization heating
    + Photoionization heating per unit volume G = \Gamma n^2
    + Heating coefficient \Gamma \approx 2e-24 erg cm^3 / s
    + Expansion cooling term is \nabla\cdot[v (E + p)]
      + where E = \rho e + 0.5 \rho v^2 and where \rho e = p / (\gamma - 1)
      + so p + \rho e = (\gamma/\gamma-1) p = (5/2) p = (5/2) \rho c^2
      + hence [v (E + p)] = 0.5 \rho v (v^2 + 5 c^2)
    + Frank:1992a writes the expansion cooling term as
      * W = (p u / \rho^2) d\rho/dr = u c^2 d ln \rho / d r
      * This is clearly energy loss per unit mass
      * \rho = \rho_0 (r/r0)^-2 if constant velocity
        + => d\rho/dr = -2 \rho / r
        + => d ln \rho / d r = -2 / r
      * W = - 2 u c^2 / r
      * Timescale is c^2 / |W| = 0.5 r/u
    + Heating per unit mass = G/\rho
      + Heating timescale is \rho c^2 / G
      + t = m c^2 / \Gamma n \propto u r^2
    + So dynamic timescale increases linearly with radius (or slightly sub-linear since v increases), but heating timescale increases quadratically (or slightly faster) with radius
      + Ratio heating/dynamic \propto u^2 r
      + Added as column to table above
    + Values at ionization front 
      + assume n \approx 8.10^6, r = 2.45e14
      + t(heat) = 0.005 years
      + t(dynam) = 3.52 years
      + Ratio is 704
      + Implies that terminal velocity is Mach number of about 4.3, reached at about r = 40 r_0
+ Putting it all together
  + Assume Mdot = 2e-7 and V = 4.3 11.5 = 50 km/s
  + Assume L_4 = 6
  + Then \eta = 0.008 => this is about half the required value, so not good but not terrible (still 40 times higher than for star!)
+ And there is another proplyd!
  + SO587 Rigliaco:2009a
  + This is also inside the arc, but it is 160 arcsec W of Aa/Ab/B
  + Mdot only 1e-9 Msun/yr so probably not a contender

**** Multi wavelength observations of the outer arc
+ Outer arc is seen at both FIR (160, 250, 350, 500 microns) and in PAH bands (7.87 micron and 12 micron)
  + However, the morphology is not the same in each
  + Shown in right hand panel of sigma-ori-inner-outer.pdf
  + Green is PAH emission, magenta is FIR
  + Not very well correlated spatially, except for in a few regions
  + Show different small-scale morphology
    + PAH is striated/filamentary
    + FIR is clumpy
+ There is also a FIR filament that runs NS through position of star
  + This can be seen on dust tau850 maps from Lombardi:2014a
  + Has peak tau850 = 4e-5 but background is 2.5e-5, so excess of 1.5e-5
  + From Lombardi:2014a we have A_K = 3460 tau850, so this is 0.05
    + Also, A_K = 0.112 A_V => A_V = 0.463
    + If we take \sigma = 5e-22 cm^2 / H, then this implies N \approx 1e21 cm^-2
      + Of course, if it is really a limb-brightened sheet, then the perpendicular column may be 10 times less than this, but let's assume not
      + Compare with critical column for star formation (): 129 Msun/pc^2 \approx 1e22 cm^-2
      + Also compare with column of HII region: 10 pcc and 10 pc => 3e20 cm^-2
      + And column of background 1.5e21 cm^-2, so dust in HII region only contributes 20% of column
    + Width of filament is about 100 arcsec = 6.13e17 cm = 0.2 pc
    + So density \approx 1631 pcc
    + This could be in pressure equilibrium with the ionized gas, if the gas temperature were about 100 K
  + The dust temperature is about 20 K (also Lombardi:2014a)
    + Some evidence that it is about 1 K cooler than the surrounding diffuse medium
    + This is consistent with general trend for T to go down with tau
    + Implies that the filament is a long way from \sigma Ori
      + The illuminated surface of the Orion B cloud is much hotter - T \approx 25 \to 30 K
      + If we assume T^6 \propto F, then we get an implied radiation field of 10 times higher.  Ochsendorf say G_0 = 100 there, so maybe it is 10 in the general medium.  On the other hand, they fit lower dust temperatures, but they do assume \beta = 1, whereas Lombardi have 1.5-ish from Planck 
**** Radio observations of IC434
+ Abramenkov:1992a
  : Observations of the extended HII regions Barnard Loop and IC 434 were carried out with the radio telescope UTR-2 at five frequencies between 12.6 and 25 MHz. The resolution of the telescope was 28 x 45 arcmin at 25 MHz. The maps of brightness distribution at the direction of the HII regions are presented. The physical parameters of the nebulae have been obtained. The electron temperature of Barnard Loop is 5900 K, the optical depth is 0.4 at 25 MHz, emission measure is 200 pc cm exp -6. The parameters are 6000 K, 2.7 and 1300 pc cm exp -6, respectively, for IC 434.
  + This is from radio observations at 12 to 20 m
  + The HII regions are seen in absorption against the non-thermal Galactic BG
  + Finds the following:
    + T = 6000 +/- 2700 K in center of IC 434 (with possible increase towards outside)
    + EM \approx 1000 pc cm^{-6}
    + n \approx 8 pcc (this implies thickness of 16 pc)
    + \tau \approx 3 at 25 MHz
  + These seem to be roughly consistent with other measurements

**** \sigma Ori as a weak-wind star
+ *Summary of following discussion*
  1. Optical/infrared spectra imply a very low mass loss rate of 2e-10 Msun/yr
     + But this is only tracing the "cool blob" component of the wind at about 50,000 K
  2. X-rays trace the hot component of wind produced by "embedded wind shocks" (EWS)
     + Observed X rays have
       - L_x = 3.2e31 erg/s \approx 1e-7 L_\star
       - T_x = 3.5 MK (0.3 keV), requires low-ish shock velocities of 550 km/s so still in acceleration zone close to star
       - VEM = 1.8e54 cm^-3
       - HWHM \approx 260 km/s, only 1/4 of terminal velocity
       - f/i ratio for Mg XI He-like triplets also requires formation close to star (< 1.5 R_\star)
     + The VEM implies mass loss of 4 to 8e-9 in hot component if it is due to EWS, much larger than in the cool blobs
  3. Lucy:2012a have a phenomenological model of how this arises by conductive evaporation of the cool blobs
  4. Alternatively, if x-rays are due to magnetic confinement of wind (MCWS), then we also require Mdot of 7.5e-9 Msun/yr
  5. The third possibility of binary wind-wind collision is ruled out since perihelion of Aa/Ab is 25 R_*, so shock would be about 15 R_* away, and wind would have full velocity and make harder x rays (> 1 keV)
  6. *Summary of summary* Ṁ = (6 \pm 2) \times 10^{-9} M_{\odot}/yr ∴ \eta = 0.005 if L_4 = 6, a bit smaller than for proplyd but the two together might do it!

+ Najarro et al 2011
  + [X] An extremely low wind mass-loss rate of 2e-10 Msun/yr is derived, mainly on the basis of Brackett alpha and other H lines.  Apparently, the Br \alpha emission increases with /decreasing/ mass loss (unlike the usual case).  The authors (priv. comm.) reckon that this result still holds, even taking into account the spectroscopic binary Aa/Ab 
+ Optical/IR spectrum implies very low mass loss rate (< 1e-9)
  * Mdot = 2e-10 Msun/yr
  * V_\infty = 1500 km/s
  * L4 = 8
  * \eta = 0.494 Mdot_{-7} V_{3} / L_{4} = 0.000185
  * L_w = 0.5 Mdot V_\infty^2 = 1.4e32 erg/s
+ But this /may/ be because the hot phase dominates the wind, as Huenemoerde:2012a claim for \mu Col
  + See [[id:C83C750D-457C-4382-987E-C1FA8CE8FD79][On the "weak wind" problem]]
+ The previous "standard" wind parameters for \sigma Ori (from Howarth:1989) were
  * Mdot = 8e-8 Msun/yr
  * V_\infty = 1060 km/s
  * L4 = 8
  * \eta = 0.494 Mdot_{-7} V_{3} / L_{4} = 0.052
+ Skinner:2008a analyze the x-rays in detail
  - L_x = 3.2e31 erg/s, which is 1e-7 L_\star
  - Consider embedded wind shocks, magnetic channeling, and possible binary wind-wind shocks
  - Deduce that a small fraction (5%) of wind mass loss is in hot phase *but* they are assuming the high mass loss rate
  - But the weak wind solution is 200 times smaller mass loss
  - [X] How does the hot-phase mass loss compare with that?
    - Observed X-ray volume emission measure is VEM = 1.8e54 cm^-3
    - This can be converted into mass loss rate if we know the inner radius
    - Using the equation (1) from Huenemoerde:2012a:
      - Taking EM_{54} = 1.8, V_{3} = 1, R_{\star }= 9 R_{\odot}, R_{0} = 1.4 R_{\star}, b = 0.97
      - 3e-9 1.06 sqrt(9 1.8 (1.4 - 0.97)) = 8.4e-9 Msun/yr
      - Or with R_{0} = 1.1 R_{\star} => 4.6e-9 (which is indeed 5% of the Howarth:1989 8e-8 value)
    - So, as compared with the 2e-10 IR value for the cool component, *the hot component is now 20 \to 40 times higher*
+ So, the only doubt is whether the x-rays really come from shocks in base of wind (EWS).
  + Two other alternatives are (Skinner:2008a):
    1. MCWS (Magnetically Confined Wind Shocks)
       - Can only work if it is just field lines close to star that are confined, because the shock speed cannot exceed 550 km/s due to relatively cool x-ray T of 3.5 MK (/argument from Skinner \S 5.2/)
       - But then (/my argument/) if we use the low mass loss rate of 2e-10, then the mechanical luminosity is only 0.5 2e-10 1.989e33 550**2 1.0e5**2 / 3.15576e7 = 1.9e31 erg/s
       - This is *lower than the observed X-ray luminosity* of 3.2e31 erg/s, so even if the shocks were 100% efficient at converting KE to x-rays they would not be enough
       - In terms of the model in Babel:1997b we have
         * L_x = 2.6e30 B_{kG}^{0.4} \xi
         * where \xi = Mdot_{-10} V_{1000}^{1.3}
         * so \xi \approx 3 for the true weak-wind scenario, which would require B = 34 kG to explain x-rays
           - Much higher than observation upper limit of a few 100 G
         * If we instead, take the x-ray derived Mdot > 4e-9 => \xi > 65, so 15 G would be enough!
           * Although we would also need to check the wind confinement parameter
           * If we assume critical confinement, as argued by Skinner, then from ud-Doula:2002a we have
             - \eta_B = B^2 R^2 / Mdot V = 1
             - Implying B = sqrt(Mdot V) / R = 1.27 (Mdot_{-10} V_{1000})^{1/2} G
             - Putting that back into the L_x equation gives L_x = 1.8e29 Mdot_{-10}^{1.2} V_{1000}^{1.5}
             - So to get observed L_x requires Mdot = 1e-10 (3.2e31/1.8e29)**(1/1.2) = 7.5e-9 Msun/yr
             - And that would have B = 11 G, which is perfectly plausible
           * So, again, consistent with the "hot-wind" mass loss rate but not the "true weak" one
    2. CWS (Colliding Wind Shocks)
       - This would be between Aa/Ab, which Skinner:2008a did not know about, although they suspected
       - [X] Need to update assessment using new info on spectroscopic binary
         - Schaefer:2016a Simon-Diaz:2015a
         - Masses of Aa and Ab are 17 and 13 Msun (while B is 11.5)
         - Distance 387.51 pc
         - Semimajor axis: a = 4.286 mas = 1.66 au = 40 R_\star
         - Eccentricity: e = 0.779 => b/a = sqrt(1 - e^2) = 0.627
         - Semiminor axis: b = 25 R_\star
         - *This is too far away* since Mg XI f/i ratio implies x-rays are formed within a few radii of star
       - And also, this suffers from a similar problem to the MCWS scenario - we need more than 100% efficiency of x-ray production in a "true weak" situation 
+ Cohen:2014a say that x-ray lines in \sigma Ori AB are /"too narrow to be understood in the context of standard EWS"/
  - EWS = embedded wind shock
  - which is their reason for not including MS stars of O9.5V or later in their analysis
  - I think what this possibly means is that in the later type stars the emission is optically thin, so come from the base of wind where velocity has not yet reached terminal

  Dear authors

  I am writing with a query about the wind parameters of the star sigma
  Ori, on which you have published papers in the last few years (Najarro
  et al. 2011A&A...535A..32N; Simón-Díaz et al. 2011ApJ...742...55S,
  2015ApJ...799..169S).

  In the Najarro 2011 paper, an extremely low wind mass-loss rate of
  2e-10 Msun/yr is derived, mainly on the basis of Brackett alpha and
  other H lines.  However, as far as I can see, the analysis assumed a
  single star, whereas Simón-Díaz 2011,2015 establish that it is a
  triple system, consisting of 3 OB stars: sigma Ori Aa, Ab, and B, with
  masses in the range 10 to 20 Msun (see also Schaefer et al
  2016AJ....152..213S).

  So, my question is: how reliable is the mass-loss determination in the
  light of the triple nature of the system?  Is it possible that the
  Brackett alpha emission from Aa is actually stronger than it seems,
  but is masked by underlying absorption from the cooler photospheres of
  Ab and B?

  The reason for my interest is that I am currently working on
  theoretical models of infrared bow shocks, and sigma Ori is an
  interesting case where it has been proposed that it is radiation
  acting on dust, instead of the stellar wind, that forms the bow shapes
  (see Ochsendorf et al 2014, 2015).  The argument hinges on whether the
  wind is really quite so extremely weak as was derived in Najarro 2011.

  I would be very grateful for any comments you may have.

  Best wishes

  Will Henney

****** TODO Add WCS info
+ Not strictly necessary, since I aligned the figure by hand

*** RCW 120, RCW 92
+ Ochsendorf:2014a
+ See also Mackey:2016a who say that RCW 120 is stellar wind bubble
  + Their model has no bow shock!
  + The enhanced 24 micron emission is just from the inner wall of the cavity blown by the stellar wind
  + There is no shocked shell in the ionized gas since all motions in the H II region are subsonic
+ These are a bit of a mess - the Ha is not obviously correlated with the 24 micron emission, but I'm not sure that this proves anything
  + The Ha emission from any bow shock or bow wave is probably weak


**** Marsh:2019a
+ Interesting paper on RCW 120
+ Applies PPMAP Bayesian procedure to find column density as function of T and \beta
  + See also Marsh:2015a and Marsh:2017a
  + And also Galliano:2018a for applying similar techniques to more complicated dust models

** Carina bow shocks
+ Smith:2010 Sexton:2015a, Kiminki:2017a
+ Ambient density about 1000 pcc
  + *But see below*
+ Velocities 10 to 50 km/s
+ Spectral types B0 to O7, plus some supergiants


*** Distance to Carina
+ I had been assuming 2 kpc
+ But Kuhn:2018a give 2600 +/- 300 pc
  + How would this be affected by the Stassun systematic offset?
  + 0.38 +/- 0.04 mas => 2.63 +/- 0.27 kpc
  + Stassun offset is -0.082 +/- 0.033 mas
  + This gives 2.16 +/- 0.24
+ Should actually use distance to \eta Car
  + 2.35 +/- 0.05 kpc
    + Implies parallax of 0.43 +/- 0.01 mas
    + Consistent with GAIA DR2 if offset -0.05 +/- 0.04
  + Smith:2006b
  + This should also apply to TR16 at least, and probably all of Carina

*** Main samples
+ Morphological Bow Shock Candidates
  + ERO 1-6 detected at 8 micron
    + ERO 4 best candidate for interaction with photoevaporation flow
  + ERO 36, 37, 39 detected at 24 micron
+ Color Bow shock Candidates
  + A few more of them

*** Special cases
+ ERO 18 is a B8 star - so almost no wind
  + Arc merges into a larger-scale structure
  + Has a blue [8]-[24] color, suggestive of PAH emission
    + Although perhaps it is the silicate feature
+ ERO 21 is a B1.5V star
  + No 24 micron measurement because saturated
  + Has a red [4.5]-[5.8] color, indicative of PAHs
    + So maybe not a wind bow shock, but could be radiation bow shock
  + Radius is 7.6 arcsec = 0.087 pc
    + If optically thick, we can calculate the pressure in the shell
    + L / 4 pi c R^2 = 6300 3.82e33 / 4 pi 2.99792458e10 0.073**2 3.085677582e18**2
    + P = 1.26e-9 cgs
    + External ram pressure = v^2 \rho = 2e-12 M^2 n
    + Ambient density is 630 / v10^2
      + I have calculated a better version of this including all regimes
    + Does the internal star dominate the ionization?
      + Flux from B1V star at 0.087 pc distance
        + S = 10^46 
      + Distance from luminous stars in Tr 14 is about 80 arcsec
        + 0.9 pc, so 10 times further 
  + Modelled as asymmetric bow shock by Ngoumo:2013a
    + The call it the "Sickle"
    + Has sub-mm clump just in front of it
      + Central column density of clump is 1.3e22 /cm^2 they say
      + Size is about 10 arcsec radius = 0.11 pc
      + So central density is about 2e4 pcc
    + Broad and narrow-band HST images show that the optical emission is all scattered continuum, with no detectable emission lines
      + small-scale shells closer to the star
  + Hartigan:2015a also comment on this object (sec 4)
    + They call it Tr 14 MJ 218
    + Morphology is unlike any of the bright-rimmed globule arcs that they see
    + In the Br-gamma minus H_2 difference map it shows up as H_2 bright on the right-hand flank
      - this is very weird
      - suggests that we have trapped the ionization front

***** Spitzer IRAC
We have up to 8 micron

***** Herschel
+ We have the SPIRE image at 250, 350, 500 micron
+ But we mainly want the 70 micron image, which must be PACS


**** More on the Sickle Nebula (ERO 21)
+ Stellar parameters
  + B1.5V
  + 2e4 Lsun
+ Coordinates
  + 
+ Interaction with Tr 14
  + HD93129Aa (O2 supergiant)
    + Luminosity 1.5e6 Lsun
  + Others in center
    + 3 times O3.5V => another 1.5e6 Lsun
  + Luminosity ratio
    + Bolometric is factor of 100
    + Stellar wind
      + \eta \approx 1 for supergiant (or at least > 0.1)
      + \eta < 0.01 for B1.5V star
      + So wind momentum ratio is 1000 to 1e4
  + Separation from central stars
    + About 80 arcsec, so about 0.9 pc
    + Bow radius is 0.1 times separation
  + 


*** What is the ionized density in Carina?
+ Sexton say 1000 pcc by referencing Brooks:2003a
  + But as far as I can see, Brooks are only measuring the density in the PDR and molecular clouds
    + They say that the PDR emission comes from "dust lane adjacent to Tr 14" and that density is 1e4 pcc and with G_0 = 1e4
    + But then they talk of a molecular cloud that the PDR overlaps with, and has density of 1e3 pcc
+ We can calculate the mean ionized density by assuming a Stromgren sphere
  + Tr 14 stellar population has S = 1.4e50 s^{-1}
  + Radius is about 2.6 pc
    + 4 arcmin at 2 kpc 
    + n = sqrt(S / (4/3) pi R^3 \alpha_B)
    + n = sqrt(3 1.4e50 / 4 pi 2.6**3 3.085677582e18**3 2.6e-13)
    + n = 500 pcc
    + So the RMS ionized density is pretty high!
+ We can also work out lower limit on wind cavity size, by assuming momentum balance
  + Mdot = 5.3e-5 and Vw = 3000 km/s
    + Note that these are from the Smith:2006a stellar parameters, which probably overestimate the wind strength
  + At 2 pc, Pram = Mdot Vw / 4 pi R^2 = 1.2e-9
  + Whereas gas pressure is 2 n k T = 1.4e-9
+ Amazingly, they are the same, which implies that the H II region should be a  shell, with even higher density
+ But this is not quite right:
  + that is just a high density PDR that is close to the dominant star, which is an O3I supergiant
  + the region as a whole is larger
    + The bows are spread over a region of radius about 1 degree
    + => 35 pc
  + We can add together Tr 14, Tr 15, and Tr 16 and the others
    + Smith:2006a
    + Total S = 9.1e50 /s
    + So with radius of 35 pc, this gives n = 26 pcc
    + Smith:2007b look at radio emission and find that it requires an effective S = 7e50 /s
      + Presumably, the rest has been absorbed by dust, or has escaped
      + This would then give an RMS density of 23 pcc over the 1 degree radius
+ However, there is much local variation
  + Smith:2004a find peak densities at the i-fronts of evaporation flows as 2000 to 6000 pcc
    + This is from Carina's defiant finger
+ Also Oberst:2011a claim that the average density is ≲ 100 pcc
+ Parkes 3.4 cm continuum map shows considerable structure, but dominated by large scale (tens of parsecs)
  + Car I accounts for only 5% of Tr 14's ionizing radiation (Smith:2007b)
  + Car II accounts for < 1% of Tr 15's ionizing radiation 
+ Measurements of [S II] ratio from Damiani:2016a
  + Median density of 100 pcc for approaching shell
  + Median density of 200 pcc for receding shell
  + Brightest regions have 2000 pcc, but fraction of nebula > 600 pcc is very small
+ Finally, 



*** Carina kinematics
+ Low mass cluster stars 
  + Damian:2016a
    + have V = -12 (approx) 
    + Range is -10 to -15
  + Damian:2017a
    + V = -7 (mean) HELIOCENTRIC
      + It seems that LSR is -8.8 km/s bluer => -16
      + But then Kiminki:2018a say it is 11.6 km/s difference
    + sigma = 3.5 km/s
  + Kuhn:2018a
    + Use proper motions from Gaia
    + 1D velocity dispersion is 2.5 to 3 km/s for each cluster: Tr 14, 15, 16
    + But, there are inter-subcluster differences of 5 to 8 km/s
      + For instance Tr 16 is moving towards Tr 14 at about 10 km/s
+ Ionized gas seems to be expanding shells
  + Damiani:2016a
  + Red component with V = +10 HELIOCENTRIC
  + Blue component with V = -30 HELIOCENTRIC
+ Molecular gas
  + Rebolledo:2016a
  + 12CO and 13CO
  + V(LSR) = -20 is typical
    + Implies about -10 heliocentric
  + Width not so clear, since they don't mention the instrumental resolution
    + FWHM ~ 5 km/s => sigma of 2 km/s
+ High mass stars have much higher dispersion
  + Hanes:2018a
    + -40 to +20
    + FWHM is about 40 km/s
    + Implying RMS sigma of about 17 km/s
    + If that is the 1D sigma, then the 3D sigma will be 30 km/s
  + Proper motions of bow shock stars also give about 30 km/s
    + Kiminki:2017a
    + But it is not necessarily aligned with bow shock axis
    + And may be upper limit
  + Kiminki:2018a
    + Smaller dispersion: 1D sigma = 9 km/s for their reliable sample
    + Mean is 0.6 km/s
+ Conclusion
  + Relative velocities of 20 to 40 km/s between star and environment are likely
  + Roughly equal contributions from star and environment




** Kobulnicky:2018a sample
+ [ ] There seems to be some overlap with the Carina ERO sample - check this out
+ [ ] There is another high-density example
  + KGK2010-2 in Cygnus OB-2
  + Spectral type is B1V, although luminosity class is uncertain
  + Ambient density is calculated as 160 pcc, but that assumes V=30 km/s
  + R = 0.07 pc, so very similar to Carina ERO 21

  #+TBLFM: $9=$6 ($4 - $5) $7 $8**2 ; f4::$10=$5 $6 / 2.35e-5 ; f0
  + ~Bunit~ is brightness unit Jy/arcsec^2
    + 2.3504e-5 for MJy/sr
  + ~Punit~ is size unit in arcsec
  + Note that the second lot of IRAC fluxes are smoothed to the MIPS resolution and using a slightly bigger aperture
  + Herschel PACS images are in Jy/pixel
    + Pixel is 3.2 arcsec
+ ERO 29 strangeness
  + Listed as very small in Sexton:2015a: size 16.6, offset 5.2 arcsec
  + But is actually large: offset 100 arcsec!
+ ERO 16 show up clearly in Akari
  + It is seen in all 3 MIR bands, but strongest in L24
  + I measure R0 = 20 arcsec, R90 = 45 arcsec
  + Sexton:2015a had it being circular and 7.4 arcsec
  + There are several observations of similar field, for instance
    + file:data/Carina/Akari/MIR/AKARI_IRC_6171001_001_201503/
    + file:data/Carina/Akari/MIR/AKARI_IRC_6171002_001_201503/
    + Data are in the ~stacked_IM~ directory
    + Note that I had to correct the WCS to align the 3 bands with each other and with the catalog position of ERO 16
      + Need to apply files such as [[file:data/Carina/Akari/MIR/AKARI_IRC_6171002_001_201503/6171002_001_L15_long.wcs][6171002_001_L15_long.wcs]]
+ What about WISE?
  + Pixel size 1.375 arcsec
  + ~BUNIT~ says that intensity is in ~DN~, which isn't helpful
  + We could calibrate IRAC 4 against MIPS 1 with ERO 36
+ We also have Akari - but very low resolution
  + FIR is only useful for ERO 29, but MIR is much better (although spotty coverage)
    + See ERO 16 discussion above
  + FIR Bands:
    + N60 :: 65 micron
    + Wide S :: 90 micron
    + Wide L :: 140 micron
    + N160 :: 160 micron
  + MIR bands
    + 15, 18, 24 micron
+ Possible new bow shock
  + WERO 40
  + 10:47:11.68 -60:20:48.73
  + Detected in Akari, but there is only L15 observations of the field
    + Example: [[file:data/Carina/Akari/MIR/AKARI_IRC_6170001_001_201503/stacked_IM/6170001_001_L15_long.fits]]
    + Also 6170005, and 6170006
+ ERO 37 also show up in Akari L15
  + 1650296_001
*** Densities and column densities
+ Kobulnicky:2018a find the stream density by
  1. Converting the 70 micron emission to column density, using Draine:2007a
  2. Using measured chord length to convert this into shell density
  3. Assume density jump of 4 across the shock to find the pre-shock density
+ Step 3 is the most problematic, since this only applies if the shock is non-radiative
  + For O9 and above, shock is strongly radiative above n = 1 for V = 30 km/s
  + So compression should be M^2 = 9, which is twice as high
+ Conclusion: stream densities should be 2 times lower, which implies /two times lower mass loss rates/
  + But we eliminate dependence on the stream velocity, since shell density is proportional to V^2, exactly the same as external ram pressure
+ We could also do an alternative method based on the column density
  + This requires knowing the shell thickness ratio, H/R, so we can estimate the limb brightening
  + Observed column from 70 micron surface brightness is n_1 L, where L is the chord length
  + Then use n_1 H = 3/4 n_0 R
+ Relating 70 micron emission to column density
  + Quantity j_\nu gives conversion: S_70 = j_\nu N_H
  + S_70 = 8e8 Jy/sr for brightest
  + j_\nu = about 1e-11, depending on radiation field at shell
  + => N_H = 1e20 H cm^-2
    + => \tau = 0.13
  + But this is across the chord length - the thickness will be less by a factor of 5-10, so \tau < 0.026
  + We can actually work it all out from the real data
    + Compare \tau and \eta as calculated from Kobulnicky:2018a data
    + The "radius" R and thickness H is given in the previous paper Kobulnicky:2017a
      + But note that R is not R0, but more like R90 (although as far as I can see, it is not measured from the star)
    + They also have a table with the R0 values (Kobulnicky:2017a Table 5) for just the sub-sample of known distance
      + But there are some inconsistencies:
        + Source 13 (zeta Oph): 29 (K17) versus 299 (K18) arcsec.  Clearly the second is correct
        + Source 331: 25 vs 42
        + Source 381: 71 vs 220
        + I will take the second one (K18) in all cases
    + Better idea - work out the optical depth from \tau = 2 L_{IR} / L_{*}

+ Flux conversions:
  + 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg/s/cm^2/Hz
  + So we can find the total flux in erg/s/cm^2 by summing the
    spectral fluxes in Jy times bandwidths \Delta\nu in each band
    |          |  \micro{}m |   \Delta\nu Hz |

    | Herschel |  70 | 6.48e11 |
    | Herschel | 160 | 3.54e11 |
  + So, estimate for total flux in units of 1e-10 erg/cm^2/s
    + 1.45 S_8 + 0.46 S_24 + 0.0648 S_70 + 0.0354 S_160
  + But that leaves gaps in between the bands, so best to use the difference between bands as the \delta\nu:
    | \lambda, \micro{}m |  \nu, Hz |     \delta\nu | \langle \delta\nu \rangle |

  + The third column is the forward difference, while fourth column is the centered difference, which should be better
  + So this would give a better total flux of
    + 2.4 S_8 + 1.6 S_24 + 0.51 S_70
    + Note that we are only using 3 bands
    + /Old version/:
      + 2.3 S_5 + 2.5 S_8 + 0.77 S_24 + 0.24 S_70 + 0.16 S_160
  + E.g., source 13 (subbing S_12 for S_8):
    + (2.3 8 + 2.5 51.32 + 0.77 343 + 0.24 246 + 0.16 62)
    + (18.4 + 128.3 + 264.11 + 59.04 + 9.92) = 479.77e-10 = 5e-8 as in Table!
  + And source 67
    + (2.3 0 + 2.5 0.31 + 0.77 27.66 + 0.24 4.4 + 0.16 5.4)
    + (0 + 0.775 + 21.2982 + 1.056 + 0.864) = 23.99e-10 = 2.4e-9
    + This is less than 5% of the 6e-8 in table! That seemed to be based on a very high-T fit, which cannot be right.
  + So, in both cases, over 90% of total IR flux comes from 8, 24, 70 micron bands
  + In K17 they give peak S(70) in Jy/arcmin^2, whereas in K18 it is in Jy/sr
    + Conversion factor is (180 60 / pi)**2 = 1.18e7
  + SEDs: Draine:2007a uses ratios based on \nu F_\nu, so factors that multiply F_\nu for each band are (normalized to 70 micron)

*** Compare momentum efficiency with optical depth for bow shell
+ This is done in the notebook
  + [[file:Kobulnicky-samples.ipynb]]
+ Figure is written to
  + [[file:K18-eta-tau.pdf]]
+ \tau is calculated as 2 L_IR / L_*
+ \eta is calculated as P_shell / P_rad
  + Note that this is really \Xi^-1 for the shell
  + If we assume v = 30 km/s, like K18, then the ambient density is (30/11)**2 = 7.4 times lower, so that \Xi = 1000 outside shell is lowered to \Xi = 135 inside shell, so \eta = 7.4e-3
  + We have one source that is clearly in the dust-wave candidate region
    + Source 380 - HD 53367 - Herbig Be star
  + And several other sources that are marginal
    + 13 - \zeta Ophiuchus - O9.2 IV
    + 368 - KM Cassiopeia - O9.5V
    + 339 - CPR2002A37 - O5V((f)) - /probably not since \Xi_\dag = 3000 for O star/
    + 409 - HD93027 - O9.5IV
+ How does \eta relate to observed properties?
  1. Shell surface density \Sigma = \tau/\kappa
  2. Shell pressure P_{shell} = \rho a^2 = \Sigma a^2 / H = \tau a^2 / \kappa H
  3. Assume H = 0.25 R_0
  4. So \eta_{shall} = P_{shell} / P_{rad} = \Xi^{-1} = \tau a^{2} 4\pi R^{2} c / \kappa H L_{*}
  5. In fiducial terms: \eta_{shell} = 245 \tau R_{pc} T_{4} / \kappa_{600} h_{1/4} L_{4}
     - From the pairplot figure, there *is* a linear relation between R and L, which is approximately R_{pc} = 0.02 L_{4}, which implies \eta_{shell} = 5 \tau T_{4} / \kappa_{600} h_{1/4}
+ [ ] But why is there a linear relation between \eta_{shell} and \tau if the shells are not radiation-supported?
  - To make it so that the lower envelope coincided with \eta = \tau, then the \eta's would need to be brought down by a factor of 1.5
  - This could be by either
    1. Increasing \kappa - currently we have 600 cm^2/g = 1.3e-21 cm^2/H
       - In principal this will be higher for diffuse cloud dust than for dense cloud dust - see Bertoldi:1996a
       - We need to work out whether we mean absorption or extinction or radpress version of opacity
         + actually *absorption*, so hard to make it larger than 600 
       - Also, whether it is more important the FUV or the EUV
       - *But* the \eta = \tau line should be the radpress \tau, which is higher by a factor of Q_{P}/Q_{abs} = [(1 - \omega) + (1 - g) \omega]/(1 - \omega) = 1 + (1 - g)\omega/(1 - \omega) = 1.5 if \omega = g = 0.5
    2. Reducing sound speed (currently assume 1e4 K) 
       - down to 6700 K would do it (probably too cool though)
       - Cloudy models give 1.1e4 K for 40 Msun model, but 7000 K for 10 Msun model
    3. Increasing H/R, but 0.25 is probably about right for most sources
  - There is also the slight worry that as \eta is derived, it is proportional to \tau
+ Doing the same for our other objects
  + th1D, LP Ori, \sigma Ori, AE Aur
  + th1D has L_* = 2.95e4, R = 0.003 pc, L_IR = 616.6 Lsun
    + \tau = 2 L_IR/L_* = 0.042
    + \eta = 0.010 /unless/ we reduce \kappa_{600} h_{1/4}
      + There is evidence that \kappa is actually 100
      + And h could be smaller too
      + But if we move this, why not all the others?
      + With \kappa = 100 we have \eta_sh = 0.06
    + Upper limit on th1D wind (use \kappa = 100)
      + Mdot_-7 = 2.02 \eta_w L_4 / V_3
      + \eta_w = 0.060 - 1.25 0.042 = 7.5e-3

  - n_sh / n_0 = 3/4 R_0 / h from eq (22)
  - How is this consistent with eq (8)?

  + This confirms that error ellipse should have axis ratio of at least 3:1
  + If we divide by sqrt(2), then we get a sigma of
    + 0.51 dex along sqrt(\eta \tau) or 0.72 dex of \eta\tau
    + 0.16 dex along sqrt(\eta/\tau) or 0.23 dex of \eta/\tau
  + Both are dominated by luminosity uncertainty

+ Conversion to mass-loss rate
  + Mdot_-7 = 2.02 \eta_w L_4 / V_3
    + \eta_w = \eta_sh - 1.25 Q \tau
    + where Q = (Q_P/Q_abs) / 1.25
  + Mdot_-7 = (2.02 L_4 / V_3) [7.443e-4 (F_-10 D_kpc^3 \theta_as T_{4} / \kappa_{600} h_{1/4} L_{4}^2) - 7.83e-4 Q F_-10 D_kpc^2 / L_4 ]
    + = 1.503e-3 (F_-10 D_kpc^2 / V_3) [(D_kpc  \theta_as T_{4} / \kappa_{600} h_{1/4} L_{4}) - 1.05 Q]
  + So, if we are in the limit \eta_w \gg 1.25 \tau, then we can find d ln Mdot / d ln X
    + F_-10 : +1
    + D_kpc : +3
    + \theta_as : +1
    + L_4 : -1
    + V_3 : -1 (this has 50% uncertainty according to K18 => 0.18 dex)
    + Assumed parameters: T_{4} / \kappa_{600} h_{1/4}
+ Do the same with K18 mass-loss method
  + They give Mdot \propto \theta D v^2 I_70 / V_3 (\ell/R) j_70
  + Where j_70 \propto sqrt(U) \propto L_4^1/2 / \theta D
  + So we finally get Mdot \propto \theta^2 D^2 v^2 I_70 / V_3 (\ell/R) L_4^1/2 j_70
    + We still left a j_70 in there to account for changes in dust abundance or size
  + Hence for d ln Mdot / d ln X we get:
    + I_70 : +1
    + D_kpc : +2
    + \theta_as : +2
    + L_4 : -0.5
    + (\ell/R) : -1 (this is an observed quantity - assign 20% uncertainty)
    + V_3 : -1 (this is assigned per object based on spectral type)
    + Assumed parameters: v^2 \delta / j_70
+ So we can do the same error ellipse MH is us, MK is K18

    + Total flux is 6 Jy
      + Same for Orion A is 260 Jy
      + In theory, this should go as S = VEM/D^2 => VEM = D^2 S

**** Source 344 - BD +43 3654
+ Also in Cygnus, but even further to the North
+ It is quite big:
  + 193 arcsec = 1.359 pc
+ Why do we disagree about the Mdot?
+ Look at which factor is causing this
  + The Jacobian elements of Mdot/MdotK18 are:
    - D = 1 (3 vs 2)
    - L = -0.5 (-1 vs -0.5)
    - F_IR = 1 (1 vs 0)
    - I_70 = -1 (0 vs 1)
    - \theta = -1 (1 vs 2)
    - \ell/R = -1 (0 vs 1)
    - V_3 = 0 (-1 both)
+ Looking at the correlations in the jupyter notebook, I suspect that the issue may be due to \ell/R
  + We see a positive correlation of Mdot/MdotK18 with \ell/R (r = 0.70)
  + When K18's \ell/R is small, we under-predict the Mdot wrt them
  + We can get H/R from \ell/R
    + This depends on the planitude, see [[id:98B7CFD9-1F8E-4D7C-8469-30E37D5C047F][Relation between shell thickness and chord length]]
    + They are positively correlated for fixed planitude, so smaller \ell/R means smaller H/R, which would make my Mdot go up - *yes !*
    + On the other hand, for a fixed H/R, \ell/R goes up with planitude, but this is probably less important
    + From Paper IV, we get \Pi = 1.8 \pm 0.9 for all the sources
    + Looking at the sources that most deviate from the 1-to-1 line in Fig 9 (344, 369, 382, 339, 381), they all have \ell/R < 1, which implies H/R = 0.05 \to 0.13
      + This would put mass loss rates up by factor of 3 \to 10


**** Source 342 - KGK2010 2 in Cygnus OB2
+ *Idea* - maybe this is a neutral shell
  + That would bring the \eta_shell down, as with LP Ori
  + Which in turn would bring the Mdot down
  + The parabolic shape of the bow also looks similar to LP Ori
  + As does the thinness of the shell
+ Original paper for this is Kobulnicky:2010a
+ Gaia parallax: 0.6212464179320593 +/- 0.04046298818558485

    + HD 196240 - no cannot be - that is a nearby A star
+ I have downloaded Spitzer IRAC and MIPS 24 images
  + There is another bow right next to it, which is KGK2010-1
+ The PACS colors are really strange
  + bright in PACS 1 and 2
+ You can see nice parabolic wings a really long way back

*** Compare KE flux with radiation
+ In summary ::
  1. We need V > 200 km/s
  2. We need V > 300,000 \tau/\eta
     - But \eta/\tau is typically < 10 and certainly < 100
     - That means that V > 3000 km/s is required
+ Condition 1 :: shock energy radiated by dust
  + Draine:1981a shows that we need V > 200 km/s before a substantial fraction of the shock energy is radiated by dust
  + This is because grain cooling of the gas only becomes competitive above 1e6 K
  + For V = 100 km/s, the fraction is only 1%
    + This, combined with fact that shock energy is small fraction of absorbed radiative energy, means that collisional heating of the grains should be negligible
  + Note that the same shock velocities (> 200 km/s) are also those required to produce significant dust sputtering
    + V < 150 km/s, then grains of 0.01 micron can survive
    + V < 270 km/s, then grains of 0.1 micron can survive
+ Condition 2 :: shock heating > radiant heating
  + KE flux passing through = P v / 2
    + P is ram pressure, v is stream velocity
  + Absorbed radiant flux = F (1 - e^{-\tau}) \approx F \tau
    + F = incident radiation flux
    + \tau = optical depth of shell
  + Also, we have
    + wind case (\eta > \tau): P = \eta F / c
    + radiation case (\eta < \tau): P = F (1 - e^{-\tau}) / c
  + So, we have shock heating / radiation heating:
    + wind case: 0.5 (\eta/\tau) (v/c)
    + radiation case: 0.5 (v/c)
  + Note that \tau = 2 x \tau_{\star}
    + wind case: x = \eta^{1/2}
    + rad case: x = 2 \tau_{\star} or \approx 1
+ Condition 3 :: cooling length < bow size
  + satisfied for n > 0.1 pcc mainly


**** KE flux through inner shock
+ This is higher by a factor of V_w/v, which is quite a lot
+ But there is no dust in the inner wind, so must somehow transfer energy across CD
  1. Conduction - possible but suppressed by magnetic fields
  2. Direct penetration - will also be suppressed by B, but can calculate things
     - proton Larmor radius
     - collisional mean free path
+ Protons carry most of wind kinetic energy.  1000 km/s means E = 10.4 keV
+ Proton Larmor radius
  + r_L = v m c / e B = 1.04e10 (B/\micro{}G)^{-1} cm - much less than size of bow.
  + Dust grain mass for a = 0.01 micron: 1.26e-17 g or 7e6 times proton mass, so that will have a much larger Larmor radius
+ Proton collisional mean free path
+ 
*** Compare stochastic heating with thermal equilibrium
+ For the smallest grains, cooling time can be smaller than time between absorptions
  + First paper on this seems to be Duley:1973a
+ See Draine:2001a
  + Fig 11 shows that for U = 1e4, this is only for grains with < 2000 carbon atoms
  + For U = 1, it is 1e6 carbon atoms
  + Corresponding radius from their equation (47):
    + a \approx 100 \AA U^{-0.2} = 0.01 \micro{}m U^{-0.2}
      |   U |  a, \micro{}m | a, nm |

      #+TBLFM: $2=0.01 / $1**0.2 ; f4::$3=1000 $-1
  + Our Cloudy models only go down to 0.005 micron, so they should all be in equilibrium if \(U > 10\).
  + Desert:1990a propose that mid-IR emission and 2175 \AA bump are both caused by a carbon VSG population with a = 1.2 \to 15 nm, which is 0.0012 \to 0.015 \micro{}m
    + Average size is about 0.01 \micro{}m 
    + So the bottom 3 size bins of the Cloudy model are in fact VSG by the Désert definition
  + The nm-sized grains are not included in the Cloudy model
    + These are the "ultrasmall" grains that Xie:2018a say are responsible for mid-ir continuum at \lambda < 10 \micro{}m (at galaxy scales)
    + Even these would be in TE for U \ge 1e5
+ [ ] Is stochastic heating important in any of our Cloudy models?
  + We could check this by running models with ~no qheat~ option
  + In principle, we might see it when U < 10
    + But there is certainly no evidence in the T vs U plot, which we should mention
  + Law:2011a have models for young stellar population where non-equilibrium heating dominates for both carbon and silicate grains below about 20 microns, although this does depend on parameters
+ Stochastic heating means that the grain temperature no longer depends on radius
+ Witt:2000a has a different way of dividing things up:
  - typical :: 100 \to 1000 nm or 0.1 \to 1 \micro{}m (this is big!)
    - these are the only ones that penetrate the heliopause and can be found in the solar system
  - small :: 5 \to 100 nm or 0.005 \to 0.1 \micro{}m
  - very small :: 0.3 \to 5 nm or 0.0003 \to 0.005 \micro{}m
+ Maximum temperature of grains absorbing a single photon of 20 eV
  + T \approx 80000 K / N
  + So if we sublime at about 1000 K, then smallest grains have N = 80 or so
  + This corresponds to a \approx 5.5 \AA, which would set the lower limit on the VSG/USG size
*** Radiative Torque Disruption
+ Hoang:2018a
+ *Conclusions*
  1. Effect should be important if their theory is right
  2. Means that we may be missing larger grains
     - UV opacity goes up
     - IR opacity goes down
     - Change in IR emissivity unclear (T increase may compensate for \kappa decrease)
  3. But in low-\Xi (high-\eta_{sh}) cases, gas damping may mitigate this
  4. And for high stream velocities, there may be a timescale issue
+ Grains larger than certain size a_max are destroyed by spin-up from radiative torques
+ For U = 1e4, this gives a_{max} = 0.03 micron
  + Hoang:2018a Fig 1, assuming only radiation damping
  + Effectively removes upper 5 size bins in Cloudy model
+ But need to check effects of pressure that might cause extra damping
  + Gas damping time \tau \propto a / (n T^{1/2})
  + Gas damping only important when F_IR < 1
    + their eq (16)
    + \therefore n_{30} T_{100}^{1/2} > 0.4 U^{2/3} / a_{0.1}
    + So with T = 1e4, U = 1e4,  a = 0.03 we have n > 133
    + Or we can re-write in terms of \Xi
      + n T_{4}^{1/2} > 1.2 U / U^{1/3} a_{0.1}
      + T_{4}^{1/2} > 4.58 T_{4} \Xi / U^{1/3} a_{0.1}
      + \therefore \Xi < 4.7 T_{4}^{-1/2} (U/1e4)^{1/3} a_{0.1}
      + So this is only an issue 
+ Fig 2 shows dependence on L and R
  + With L4 = 1, a = 0.05 micron @ 0.1 pc or 0.1 micron @ 1 pc
+ Spin-up times are generally shortish
  + 400 years for L4 = 1, R = 0.1 pc
  + Compare dynamical time at 30 km/s : R0/v = 3260 years
  + So not amazingly shorter
+ Also, disruption only occurs for U larger than certain value
  + U > 3 for n = 30 pcc, T = 100 K
  + U > 2e4 for n = 1e5, T = 1000 K
*** Relationship between \Xi and U/n
+ U/n = L / 4 \pi R^2 F_0 n
+ \Xi = L / 4 \pi R^2 c 2 n k T
+ \therefore \Xi = (U/n) F_0 / (2 c k T) = (0.262 / T_{4}) U/n
+ \therefore U = 3.82 n T_{4} \Xi
*** Relationship between U and \chi or G
+ Difference is that
  + U is 0 \to 8 \micro{}m energy density over MMP83 solar neighborhood value
    + Equivalent flux is 2.17e-2 erg/cm^2/s
    + For an O star, this range represents 100% of bolometric luminosity 
  + G or \chi is 0.0912 \to 0.2 \micro{}m flux divided by Habing solar neighborhood value
    + Habing flux is 1.6e-3, which is only 7.4% of MMP value
    + For 10, 20, 40 Msun models, the FUV range is 72%, 64%, and 43% of bolometric luminosity
  + So, this means that G/U = [72, 64, 43]/7.4 = [9.7, 8.6, 5.8]
*** Relationship between U and eV/cm^{3}
+ This is used by Desert:1990a who suggest that PAH start to disappear when radiation field is > 30 eV/cm^3 for O stars
+ 30 eV/cm^3 => c u = 1.44 erg/s/cm^2 => U = 66

:END:
+ [2019-02-13 Wed] Return to this issue now that I have a better understanding of the U values and what they mean
+ K18 calculate U = u/u(Mathis)
  + This is different from the G = F_{FUV}/F(Habing)
    + First, they are working in terms of energy density, u, not flux
      + Although for monodirectional radiation it is just F = u c
    + Second, they are basing things on Mezger:1982a and Mathis:1983a who specify the entire SED of the IS radiation field.  This is what is used in Draine:2007a
    + Problem is that this Mathis field includes multiple cool stellar components that emit at longer wavelengths.  
    + I integrate the radiation field of Mezger:1982a Table C1
      + Take FUV range from 912 to 2000 Angstrom
        + \Delta\lambda = 0.11 \micro{}m
      + The average field there is about 15 in the table units
      + Units are 4 \pi J_\lambda / 1e-3 erg/cm^2/s/\micro{}m
      + So I get 4 \pi J_FUV = 15 0.11 0.001 = 1.6e-3 => *exactly the Habing value*
    + But the optical peak around 0.55 micron has 16.4, so adds another roughly
      + 16.4 0.55 0.001 = 9e-3 in same units
      + Optical emission is 6 times higher than FUV emission
    + Plus, they have another peak in the FIR
    + The total flux is 2.17e-2 erg/cm^2/s from Mathis:1983a
      + This means that the FUV flux is 0.074 times the total
      + 1/0.074 = 13.5
+ Habing FUV version
  + F(Habing) = 1.6e-3 erg/s/cm^2
  + They find G values from 300 to 3e4
  + Using F = L / 4 \pi R^2, we get G = 200 L_{4} R_{pc}^{-2}
  + [X] Need to compare this with their U to see how they are normalizing
+ Mathis full SED version
  + F(Mathis) = 2.17e-2 erg/cm^2/s
  + Using F = L / 4 \pi R^2, we get U = 14.7 L_{4} R_{pc}^{-2}
+ We could also write U = 3.01 n v_{10}^{2} / x^2 


**** Equivalent U for Ly-\alpha
+ Is it possible that the deviation from the DL07 line seen in [[file:K18-emissivity-vs-U.pdf]] might be due to Lyman \alpha heating?
+ Lyman line intensity is (following Henney:1998a)
  + 4\pi J = \alpha_B n h\nu / \sigma for fully ionized dust-limited case [erg/s/cm^2]
  + h\nu = 0.75 13.6 eV = 1.63e-11 erg assuming just Ly-\alpha
    + In reality it will be slightly larger because of the fractions of \beta, \gamma, etc
    + Maximum value is 2.18e-11
  + Normalizing to F = 2.17e-2 and supposing \alpha_B = 2.6e-13, \sigma = 1.3e-21 (\kappa = 600 cm^2/g)
    + we get U = 2.6e-13 1.63e-11 / 1.3e-21 2.17e-2 = 0.15 n / \kappa_{600}
    + which is really small unless n is large
    + Compare with stellar radiation: 
      + U_{lines} / U_{star} = 0.010 n R_{pc}^{2} / L_{4} \kappa_{600}
      + From our eq (14) we have R_{*,pc}^{2} = 4.88 L_{4} / n v_{10}^{2}
      + n / L_{4} = 4.88 / v_{10}^{2} R_{*,pc}^{2} 
      + So U_{lines} / U_{star} = 0.049 (R/R_{*})^2 / v_{10}^{2}  = 0.049 x^{2} / v_{10}^{2} \kappa_{600}
      + where x <= 1 unless we have WR star with \eta_{w} > 1
      + *Conclusion:* U_{lines} / U_{star}  is always negligible, even if dust opacity is anomalously low
        + For example, pushing all the parameters to be as favorable as possible for Lyman lines
        + \kappa_{600} = 0.1, v = 20 km/s, x^{2} = 1 (slow stream, strong wind, low dust opacity)
        + \therefore U_{lines} / U_{star} = 0.12
  + Taking P_rad = 4\pi J / 3c, we can calculate \Xi for Lyman lines:
    + \Xi = P_rad / P_gas = \alpha_B h\nu / 6 \sigma k T c = 0.013 T_{4}^{-1.7} \kappa_{600}^{-1}^{}
  + Can also apply to entire H II region
    + F_lines = \alpha_B n h\nu / \sigma
    + F_star = L / 4 \pi R^2
    + Ionization balance: L = h\nu (4\pi/3) R^3 n^2 \alpha_B
    + \therefore F_star = (1/3) \alpha_B n^2 h\nu R
    + \therefore F_lines / F_star = 3/ R n \sigma = 3 / \tau
    + So Ly-\alpha dominates on the scale of the H II region, unless \tau \approx 1, in which case they are similar

**** What Kobulnicky are doing with their model fitting
+ [2019-02-13 Wed] /This seems to be a rehash of what I say above, but at least it is consistent/
+ They claim to be calculating U from their stellar parameters:
  + U = \sigma T^{4} (R_{*}^{2} / R_{0}^{2}) / U_{0}
  + where U_{0} = 2.17e-2 erg/cm^2/s
  + This should give 0.01329 T_{eff,4}^{4} R_{1R\odot}^{2} R_{pc}^{-2}
+ And they should have L = 4 \pi \sigma T^{4} R_{*}^{2}
  + U = L / (4 \pi R_{0}^{2} U_{0})
  + U = 14.7 L_{4} R_{pc}^{-2}

*** Equivalence between K18 observational quantities and mine
+ First step is determining column densities
  + Although mine is radial, theirs is LOS
  + I use \Sigma = \tau / \kappa = LIR / L_* \kappa = FIR D^2 / L_* \kappa
  + They use \Sigma = S70/j = FIR / \theta^2 j
+ Although we also need to think about the \theta in S70 = F70/\theta^2
  + Is this proportional to the bow size
+ Then there are geometric factors concerning H and \ell
*** Accuracy of photometry
+ MIPS has stated precision of 4\% for point sources
+ Ratio between mine and K17 fluxes gives std of 0.07

+ Note that they *do* find an outer dust wave for the small grains
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Stellar radiation force is especially important for small dust grains with radii rd ≤ 0.1 μm. These dust grains are swept out far away by the stellar radiation and do not cross the BS. Therefore, in our calculations we consider the dust grains with rd>0.2μm.
  #+END_QUOTE
+ But, they aren't interested in it, so they don't study it further!
+ Details of MHD simulation
  + They have a very thick outer shell
  + Because the have a perpendicular magnetic field and alfven Mach number of 1.77
    + Although they say they tried other values
  + The dust density is concentrated towards the outer shock
  + But the 24 micron emissivity is very concentrated towards the contact discontinuity (astropause)
  + [ ] I would have thought that at longer wavelengths the dust emissivity is less T-sensitive and so you should be able to see the outer shock
+ They find that their 1 micron grains are not warm enough to explain the observations
  + But that if they reduce the grain size, then they must also reduce B strength to maintain filament spacing
  + And they don't want to do that because it would collapse their shell
  + *BUT*, if we actually have an outer dust wave, then the shell is irrelevant
    + Although would the radius work out?
    + They are ignoring increases in grain potential, so they won't get the dust wave right anyway
    + In their discussion and Fig 13 they say that drag forces are unimportant, but this is because they are U = 0.75 to 1.6 V
      + U = Z e / a in statV = 300 Z e / a in V
      + \phi = e U /k T = 1.16 T_4^-1 U(V)
      + So they have maximum \phi = 1.86, but it should really get to \phi \sim 8, or U = 7 V
      + So they underestimate f_max by a factor of (8/1.86)**2 = 18.5
+ Let's work out all the parameters for this star
  + L_4 = 30.2
  + V_3 = 1.0
  + Mdot_-7 = 20
  + T_eff = 23.5
  + n = 3 to 11 pcc (typical 5 pcc)
  + B = 18 to 35 \micro{}G
  + v_10 = 2.81
+ So
  + R_* = 2.21 sqrt(L_4/n) / v_10 = 1.93 pc
  + \tau_* = 0.0089 \kappa_600 sqrt(L_4 n) / v_10 = 0.039
  + \eta_w = 0.495 Mdot_-7 V_3 / 30.2 = 0.33
+ Therefore \tau_*^2 < \eta_w and we are well into WBS regime
  + And from Paper I Fig 4, we have not trapped the i-front
  + So R_0 = sqrt(\eta_w) R_* = 1.11 pc
  + Observed is 0.75 pc, so we may need to adjust density
  + Except that they ascribe this difference to magnetic effects
    + To explain the R_0 = 0.75 pc with pure ram pressure, we would need a density higher by a factor (1.11/0.75)**2 = 2.19
    + So, we try n = 10, which gives
      + R_* = 1.36 pc
      + \tau_* = 0.055
      + R_0 = sqrt(\eta_w) R_* = 0.78 pc (which is close enough)
+ Radiative turnaround radii
  + Rstarstar = \kappa_d L / 2 \pi c v_\infty^2
  + In pc, this is Rss = 0.4912 (L_4 / v_10^2) (Q / \rho_d a_\micro)
  + For \kappa Cas (L_4 / v_10^2) = 3.8
  + So, with \rho_d = 3 and Q = 1, I get Rss = 0.622 / a_\micro
    + a = 0.2 micron => Rss = 3.11 pc
    + a = 0.02 micron => Rss = 31 pc
    + a = 1 micron => 0.622 
  + Ka18 has
    + R_0 = 0.75 pc
    + R_BS = 5 R_0 = 3.75 pc
+ For BSG Cloudy models:
  + \Xi_\dag = 300 \to 500 for silicate grains
  + \Xi_\dag = 1000 for graphite grains
+ Also, U = 14.7 L_4 / R_pc^2
  + For 0.75 pc we have U = 790
  + And U = 3.82 n T_4 \Xi
  + \Xi = U / 3.82 n = 41, assuming n = 5
  + That is very low!
    + With \phi = 1.5 (2.3 + ln \Xi) it gives \phi = 9
  + But, density goes up in shell although only by a factor of 2
+ So, for the 3 dust wave criteria (use \Xi_\dag = 300):
  - v_10,min = sqrt(\Xi_\dag \eta_w) = 9.94
    - So, no way is that satisfied: need 100 km/s
    - Other way of putting it: R_\dag = v_10 R_* / sqrt(\Xi_\dag) = 0.162 R_* = 0.31 pc
  - No point calculating the others, but might as well
  - \tau_*,max = 0.5 v_10 / sqrt(\Xi_\dag) = 0.081, so we have \tau_* < \tau_*,max
  - \kappa/\kappa_d \tau_*,max = 8.1e-4, so we would be in drag-confined regime
  - \tau_*,min = 0.0028, so we have \tau_* > \tau_*,min  
+ This means that collisional coupling is strong
  + With \Xi = 40, drift velocity should be < 1 km/s, at least for up to 0.25 micron
  + f_rad = 40 f_*
+ RATD
  + Dynamic time is 0.75 pc / 28.1 km/s = 2.61e4 y
  + Destruction time for 2 micron grain is about 1 year!
    + Dynamic time scales as R
    + Destruction time scales as 1/U or R^2
    + Evolution time scale is about 1e6 years
  + Max grain size is about 0.04 microns

+ Located at N edge of IC348 open cluster
  + 9 arcmin away = 0.8 pc
  + Has similar proper motion to cluster:
    + [+6, -6] mas/yr versus [+6, -9]
    + So may be moving N in cluster frame at 5 km/s
    + Could have got to present position in 0.2 Myr
+ Green in WISE - bright at W2  - 4.538 micron
  + [ ] There are all sorts of Spitzer data we could look at
    + It is observed by MIPS and IRAC (Currie:2009a)
    + But their figures are so saturated, you can't see anything
+ R = 27 arcsec = 0.04 pc
+ Reflection nebula in optical
+ It is candidate source for one of the COMPLETE shells
  + CPS 11
  + Arce:2011a Table 1
  + Radius = 2.3 arcmin in CO (0.2 pc), 1.5 arcmin in IR
  + So this is the larger shell seen in W4 22 micron
  + Source is called IC348 LRL 3
  + Also seen in CO, with slightly larger radius still
    + Mass = 6 Msun
    + V = 2 km/s
    + Momentum 11 Msun km/s
    + They claim these are wind-driven, but that seems very unlikely to me
    + Especially if the winds are trapped at smaller radii
  + We could work out stellar momentum over a certain time span
    + In 1 My, with 1 Lsun we get L t / c = 4.0e36 g cm/s = 0.02 Msun km/s
    + So we would need 550 Lsun to accelerate observed shell in 1 Myr
    + An A0 star has a luminosity of 24 Lsun, so this would need 20 Myr, which might be too long (500 Lsun is a B5 star)
      + Unless it is larger than MS
      + Currie:2009a measure R = 4 Rsun
      + => L = 145 Lsun, so this is closer
      + Luminosity would have been larger in the past, presumably
      + Age is 2.5 Myr according to Currie:2009a
      + So, we are now at 2.5 145 = 362.5, which is nearly up to the 550 Lsun required, given that luminosity is dropping with time (although on Henyey track this isn't necessarily true)
    + Also, this assumes that shell traps all light
      + so N > 2e21 cm^-2
      + M / 4 pi R^2 mp = 1.49e21, so just about optically thick
      + \tau = M \kappa / 4 pi R^2 = 1.5 if \kappa = 600 cm^2/g
    + So, argument is that we need \eta = 20 to drive the shell with momentum

+ LP Ori
  - this is very similar to our 10 Msun example star.
  - the 0.01 pc line is a very interesting one
    - if the relative velocity is low (< 20 km/s), then we are in the radiation-supported bow wave regime
    - if it is higher, then it may be a dust wave
+ \theta^1 D
  - This is part-way between the 10 and 20 Msun models
  - Low velocities, < 80 km/s or so, imply a radiation bow shock
    - With very high densities, > 1e5 pcc
    - Is this possible?

* Fitting the arc shapes

** Comments on \theta^{1} D and LP Ori fits

*** \theta^{1} D fits
+ E.g., [[file:arc-fits/th1D-75.pdf]]
+ The symmetry axis of the circle fits is always about PA175
  + This is different from the brightness axis, which is more like PA200
+ Also, it looks like we could maybe add some more arc points on the left hand side
  + This would mean we would get a proper R90 for that side

*** LP Ori fits
+ E.g., [[file:arc-fits/lp-ori-110.pdf]]
+ This is even worse
  + Symmetry axis of fits is around PA050
  + But global axis is more like PA010
+ The fundamental problem here is that the star position is too far from the symmetry axis of the bow, and this is what leads to the circle fit algorithm breaking down
*** TODO It might be better to fit a parabola to all the points
+ 4 parameters
  + (x, y) of apex
    + It might work better if this were specified by hand, perhaps guided by the maximum in brightness
  + position angle of tail
  + coefficient a in y = a x^2
+ Then can calculate the deviation of the central star from the parabola axis
+ And can do circle fit to the points around the axis, which hopefully will be more consistent than the unconstrained version
  + We could make a pseudo-center by projecting the star position onto the parabola axis

* Expected velocities
+ Velocity dispersions
  + Increase as \sigma \propto L^{1/4}
  + Relationship between L_Ha and Q_H
    + assume fraction 0.4 of recombs lead to H\alpha
    + Then L_Ha = 0.4 Q_H E_Ha
    + E_Ha = 3.026e-12 erg
    + L_Ha = 1.2e37 Q_49
  + Bordalo:2011a have L_Ha = 1e39 to 1e42
    + So Q = 1e51 to 1e54
    + For comparison, Carina has only 1e51
      + So expect 3 times higher velocity dispersion than in Orion
