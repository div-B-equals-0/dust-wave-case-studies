* Case studies of interesting objects for inclusion in bow paper II
** Selection criteria
+ High-ish ambient densities, since that is more likely to give an "interesting" case (e.g., radiation bow wave)
+ Prefer B stars to O stars, since then it is easy to get dust waves (gas--grain separation)
** Particular objects
*** OB bowshocks in Orion Nebula
**** LP Ori
**** \theta^1 Ori D
*** Ones in Ochsendorf papers
