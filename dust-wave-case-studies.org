Case studies of interesting objects for inclusion in bow paper II

* Selection criteria
+ High-ish ambient densities, since that is more likely to give an "interesting" case (e.g., radiation bow wave)
+ Prefer B stars to O stars, since then it is easy to get dust waves (gas--grain separation)


* Open questions
** Determining shell pressure from MIR observations
*** 70 micron peak brightness method
+ Kobulnicky 2018 do this using the Peak 70 micron emission from Herschel
  + Values are 4.6 \to 90 in units of 10^7 Jy/sr (median about 20)
    + So, 200 MJy/sr or \nu I_\nu = 0.008 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + Observationally, this is problematic since 70 micron 
+ ERO 21 has 4.5 Jy/pix = 18700 MJy/sr
  + 20 times higher than highest (900) in K18 sample
  + Background is 1.5 Jy/pix = 6230 MJy/sr
    + Confirmed with Akari 65 micron, although the source itself has disappeared (maybe point sources have been removed).  Also, Akari is roughly 25% brighter across the board
  + If we calculate U = 15 L4 / R_pc^2 with L4 = 0.63 and R_pc = 0.09, then U = 1160
  + This gives 70 micron emissivity of j_\nu = 2.5e-12 (Jy/sr) (cm^2/H) from K18 Fig 2
    + [ ] *NOTE* we need to recalculate j_\nu from the Cloudy models - I suspect that they should be higher for illuminating SEDs that are dominated by the UV.  The K18 graph uses Draine:2007a, which assumes an ISM SED
  + So dividing peak brightness by emissivity, we get a H column of 18700 1e6 / 2.5e-12 = 7.48e21 H/cm^2
  + Using m = 1.3 mp gives line of sight surface density: \sigma = 0.01626 g/cm^2
  + Assuming a limb-brightening boost factor of 5 and \kappa = 600 cm^2/g gives a perpendicular UV optical depth \tau = 1.95
  + /On the cusp between bow wave and radiation-supported bow shock/
  + We can also get the density:
    + Path length is about 6 Herschel pixels = 19.2 arcsec = 0.21 pc = 6.48e17 cm
      + With limb-brightening of 5, this gives shell thickness h = 0.042 pc = 1.30e17 cm
    + So mean density is n = 7.48e21 / 6.48e17 = 1.15e4 pcc
    + Could this be fully ionized?  Perpendicular emission measure is 1.3e17 1.15e4**2  = 1.71396e25 cm^-5
    + => required ionizing flux is 2.6e-13 1.71396e25 = 4.46e12 phot/cm^2/s
    + Given S49 = 0.00013, available ionizing flux is 1.34e9 phot/cm^2/s, so it must be mainly neutral
      + Assuming that bulk of column is at 1000 K, then the ionized density would be 20 times less => 575 pcc
      + Then, thickness of ionized layer would be 1.34e9 / 575**2 2.6e-13 = 1.56e16 cm = 0.005 pc
      + This is 0.12 times the total thickness, so ionized gas is only 0.006 times the total column
      + That would explain why we see no H alpha emission
+ Ero 5 has 0.025 Jy/pix = 100 MJy/sr but with large errors because of bright BG
  + This is the same as source 407 in K18, which gives 582 MJy/sr as peak brightness, which would be 0.14 Jy/pixel
  + Background is 0.45 Jy/pixel, so they are saying there is an excess of 30% of BG
  + Re-looking at the cuts, I think 0.14 is just about allowable if we assume that the BG falls off at the position of the bow, but that is extreme special pleading
+ ERO 36 or K18 406
  + The 70 micron emission can be measured more reliably in this object, since it has a better contrast with the continuum
    + 0.32 peak - 0.24 +/- 0.01 bg = 0.08 Jy/pix = 330 MJy/sr
    + K18 have 291 MJy/sr, so we actually agree!
    + BG is about 1000 MJy/sr at both 70 and 160 micron
    + So that is 57 times lower than for ERO 21
    +

+ Certainly a bow shock, and seems to be centered on a star
  + But this may be a coincidence - possibly it is an HH object that just happens to be passing by
  + There is a reflection nebula to the S
  + [X] Need to check adjacent fields to the E, to see if there is any sign of a train of knots or a possible source

  + Might be jet instead of bow, or indeed anything
+ Actually, there is another bow nearby, and maybe a 3rd one further N in the same field
+ There are also some clear jets, which do look different
+ Need to check out MIR bands
* MIR spectra of H II regions
+ Lots of times when people talk about H II region, what they really mean is PDRs and PAHs
+ But there are some real spectra of real ionized gas
+ They show *no* PAH emission, but strong VSG continuum
+ Also occasionally Silicate emission at 10 and 20 micron
+ And occasionally an emission band at 23 micron, possibly from FeO (see Koike:2017a)
+ Examples
  + NGC 3603 Lebouteiller:2007a
    + VSG emission is measured from continuum at 14 micron
    + Anticorrelates with PAH emission
    + VSG/PAH is high within 4 pc of star cluster
    + Intensity correlates with intensity of [S IV] line
    + PAH/VSG falls with [S IV]/[Ne II], which they call "hardness", but is really a proxy for ionization parameter
    + MIR diagnostic diagram
      + 6.2 micron PAH/6 micron continuum on x axis
      + 13.8/6 continuum ratio on y axis
      + Ionized region has y constant at about 40, finally decreasing to about 10 in the PDR
      + Values of x range from about 0.3 to 1.0 (and then higher, as you go into the PDR)
    + Cluster properties
      + D = 7 kpc, A_V = 4.5 (mainly foreground)
      + S = 1e51 /s in Ly-c
      + Lbol = 1e7 Lsun
    + Correlation with radiation field
      + U = 15 L4 / R^2 = 1.5e4 / R^2 with R in pc
      + Stellar wind cavity out to 1 pc with very little emission
      + Silicate emission for 1 to 2 pc => U > 4000
      + [S IV]/[Ne II] is supposedly "hardness", but I suspect will be more like ionization parameter.  For constant density, this will be a tracer of U.  But we will call it H
        + Reading Madden:2006a is more enlightening about this.  They are comparing regions between galaxies of different metallicities, so for them [Ne III]/[Ne II] really is diagnostic of the hardness of the radiation field.  But that won't necessarily be the case within a single cluster
        + Ratio is H = 1 at about 4 pc, so we would predict H = (R/4)^-2, which works well
          + H(R = 2) = 4 (observed 4)
          + H(R = 8) = 0.25 (observed 0.3)
        + So the prediction is H = U/1000 for this density
  + [ ] Other regions
+ Dopita:2008a on compact H II regions that are ionization bounded (plus PDRs out to column of 1e22 H/cm^2)
  + This has SEDs for different pressures and masses of star
    + M = 20 to 100 Msun
    + P/k = 1e6 to 1e9 at the i-front, corresponding to densities of 100 to 1e5 pcc
      + In Orion we have
        + P/k = 2e8 in Orion S region (0.02 pc)
        + P/k = 2e7 in Bar (0.2 pc)
        + down to P/k = 1e6 in EON (2 pc)
        + In theory it should be Q/4 pi R^2 = \alpha n^2 H
          + So that n \propto R^{-1} H^{-1/2}
          + Which would be R^{-3/2} if H \propto R
          + That fits the Bar-EON ratio OK, whereas R^-1 fits better the OrionS- Bar ratio

    + They find that the IR SEDs have luminosities of roughly the stellar luminosity in all cases, unsurprisingly
    + Low P/k have intense PAH band emission and continuum peaks at 60 micron
    + High P/k means that PAH goes away and dust continuum peaks at 20 microns, and we see the Silicate emission peaks
+ [ ] Zhu:2008a have kinematics of lots of compact H II regions in [Ne II] lines
  + Many sources have bow-shaped morphologies
  + They consider different models for the kinematics
    + A: Expanding shell
    + B: Expanding sphere
    + C: Bow shock
    + D: Parabolic shell with pressure-driven flow along the shell
    + E: Filled blister flow
  + /Comments/
    1. They do not fairly represent the blister flow.  They have it being very convex, which is not at all like Henney:2005a models.  Still, the predictions of flow perpendicular to bow should be easy to rule out
    2. They find most sources to be of type D, but there is really no difference between a slow-moving bow shock and their model D
       + I suppose it is different in the sense that the ionized velocity reached in the wings is not due to the relative velocity of the confining stream
  + We should look at some of these sources and see if they have IR SEDs available

* How to normalize the radiation field
+ This is related to [[id:33290714-FA0D-44D4-9541-2D54DD74E4D2][Compare Ly\alpha heating with stellar heating]] below
+ Relano:2016a is an interesting case study
  + They compare the Mathis:1983a ISRF with that produced by a 4Myr massive cluster
  + Unsurprisingly, the cluster SED is all UV, whereas the ISRF is only about 5% UV
  + They find that, using the cluster SED, they need to use a 60 times lower total flux in order to fit the same dust emission
* Conversions
+ Many maps use MJy/sr as brightness unit
  + Kobulnicky:2018a uses 10^7 Jy/sr
+ Salgado plots surface brightness SEDs as \nu I_\nu in erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg/s/cm^2/Hz
  + \nu = c / \lambda = 2.99792458e14  / \lambda(micron)
  + So, 1 MJy/sr means that \nu I_\nu = (0.003 / \lambda_\mu) erg/s/cm^2/sr
+ Herschel maps are in Jy/pixel, where pixel is 3.2 arcsec
  + 1 Jy/pixel = 4155 MJy/sr
  + 1 Jy/pixel @ 70 micron = 0.178 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + *No, this is only at 160* At 70 microns, they are 1.6 arcsec pixels, so multiply by 4
+ Flux in Jy
  + In each square arc second: 1 MJy/sr means 2.35e-5 Jy
  + In each square arc minute: 1 MJy/sr means 0.0846 Jy
* Wind radiative momentum efficiency for a broader class of objects
+ We can calculate \eta a lot more broadly than just for OB star winds
  + \eta = 0.495 Mdot(-7) V3 / L4
+ Wolf-Rayet stars
  + Can have \eta > 1, so radiation support is never important (unless \tau is high enough to trap the re-emitted IR radiation too)
+ Strong-wind T Tauri stars
  + Take L = 10 Lsun, Mdot = 1e-8, and V = 200 km/s
  + Gives \eta = 10, implying a non-radiative driving of the wind
+ Proplyds:
  + L = 0.1 Lsun, Mdot = 1e-8, V = 30
  + Gives \eta = 150
+ The outer \eta
  + If \eta_out < \tau, then the bow can be /radiatively confined/
  + If interacting with another stellar wind, then this is just the \eta of the other star
    + For instance, the inner proplyds in Orion that interact with \theta1 C wind
      + Mdot(-7) V3 = 4.2 \pm 1.5 ; L = 2.5e5 Lsun
      + \eta = 0.495 4.2 / 25 = 0.08 
    + The optical depth of the shell in this case is from the inner wind
      + \tau = \kappa \sigma
      + where \sigma = (3 Mdot / 16 \pi R0 Vw)
      + or for proplyd: \sigma = (3 m n0 r0^2 / 4 Ms R0)
        + where r0, n0 are radius and density at i-front
        + Ms \approx 3 is Mach number at shock
        + m is mean mass per nucleon
      + Using R0 = 1e16 R16, n0 = 1e6 n6, r0 = 1e15 r15, \kappa = 600
        + \tau = 0.033 n6 r15^2 / R16

        + So this is about 0.05 for the strongest case (167-317), which is smaller than \eta, meaning that radiative confinement does not dominate, but might be important
          + /however/, there is evidence that the 11 micron dust opacity

***** Turns out, LP Ori is a Herbig Be star
+ This is presumably why it has an excess at 2 microns and 8 microns
+ Alecian:2013a do spectropolarimetry of it

  + A_V = 1.55, which is highish
  + L = 10**(3.22 +/- 0.07) = 1580 +/- 260 Lsun, again much less than I had thought
  + M \approx 7 Msun, so not even a high-mass star
  + Age = 200,000 years
  + Strong magnetic field: B_z  =-240 +/- 70 G
+ First detected B field in Petit:2008a
  + Variable with phase
  + Gives B2 spectral type
+ Other Ae/Be stars have similar reflection nebulae

    + But it seems to be a G2 star, and probably low mass

  + But they are talking of very small scales: 130 AU (would be 0.325 au at Orion)
  + There is extended emission on scales of ten arcsecs, but his seems to be mainly PAH emission

**** Models for LP Ori
***** How to derive density of dust shell
+ We can estimate \tau for the shell
  + L_{neb} = L_{*} (1 - e^{-\tau}) (\Omega / 4\pi)
    + Assume (\Omega / 4\pi) = 1/2
    + \tau = -ln[ 1 - 2 L_{neb}/L_* ]
  + Absorption \tau in the UV from the MIR SED
    + L_{neb} = 155 Lsun
    + L_{*} = 2000 Lsun if B2
    + => \tau_{abs}(UV) = 0.168 /although it might be slightly higher if we have a peak around 30-40 micron/
  + Scattering \tau in the optical from the optical SED
    + Table of optical reflection nebula (see [[id:16B7695B-DB17-46EE-947F-B833BCFA3451][Plot total SED for LP Ori]])

    + Conclusion: \tau_{scat}(optical) \approx 0.3 in the optical
+ Now we can estimate the density and hence pressure in the bow shell
  + Assume shell thickness h \approx 0.2 R
  + R \approx 0.01 pc => h \approx 0.002 pc = 6.17e15 cm
  + \tau = \kappa \rho h
  + According to Hazy3 Fig 7.1, we have the following cross-sections for ISM dust
    + Scattering around 0.2 Ryd (5000 \AA): 2e-22 cm^{2}/H => \omega \kappa = 100 cm^{2}/g
    + Absorption around 1 Ryd: 1.6e-21 cm^{2}/H => (1 - \omega) \kappa = 736 cm^{2}/g
    + But this is clearly inconsistent with the observed SED
      + We have \tau_{scat}(optical) \approx \tau_{abs}(UV) (or even higher), whereas the ISM dust has it being 7 times lower
      + [ ] We should calculate the same for the Orion dust
    + For the time being, we will use the optical value as being more credible
  + So we have
    + n = \tau / m \kappa h
    + \tau = 0.3, \kappa = 100 cm^{2}/g, m = 2.17e-24 g, h = 6.17e15 cm
    + => n = 2.24e5 / \kappa_{100} cm^{-3}
    + Column is N = 1.4e21 cm^{-2} 
  + But to calculate the pressure, we need to know if it is ionized or not
  + Ionizing flux from B2 star
    + 6.3e46 s^{-1} according to Smith:2006a
    + L_{4} = 1.55
    + Ionizing flux at R = 0.01 pc is F = 5.26e12
    + ionized layer thickness is h_{i} = F / \alpha_{B} n^{2} = 4e14 cm
      + corresponding to 0.065 arcsec
    + So we have h_i \approx 0.065 h
  + Just for completeness, do flux from th1C
    + R = 0.6 pc - 60 times further away
    + S = 8e48 s^{-1} more or less - 100 times bigger
    + So F = 100/60**2 = 0.0278 times that from LP Ori itself, or 36 times smaller
  + What about H\alpha emission from inner portion?
    + Ionized density, assuming stromgren sphere with R = 0.01 pc
    + 4/3 \pi R^3 n^2 \alpha_B = S
    + n = sqrt(3 S / 4 \pi R^3 \alpha_B) = 4.4e4 pcc
    + Ionized column: 1.35e21 => \tau = 0.295 if \kappa = 100 - suprisingly high!
  + [ ] And the observed Ha brightness
    + Need to calibrate the Ha image
  + Back to the shell pressure
    + Assuming T = 1000 T_{3} K, then pressure is
    + P_{shell} = n k T = 3.12e-8 T_{3}/\kappa_{100} cgs
  + Radiation pressure is (1 - e^{-\tau}) times L / 4\pi R^{2} c
    + The \tau is the rad pressure version, averaged over spectrum, but assume 0.3
    + => (1 - e^{-\tau}) = 0.26 \approx \tau
    + P_{rad} = 1.06e-7 \tau L_{4} cgs
    + With L_{4} = 0.2 and \tau = 0.3 we get P_{rad} = 6.36e-9 cgs
      + So radiation can pressurize the shell if T < 500 K and \kappa > 200 cm^2/g
  + Photoevaporated disk wind
    + With S = 6e46 then Richling:1997a Fig 7 gives
      + Mdot = (3 - 6)e-7
      + Depending on treatment of dust scattering
    + Hollenbach:1994a have an analytic formula:
      + 1e-5 sqrt(M_{10} S_{49}) Msun/yr
      + With M_{10} = 0.7, S_{49} = 0.006, we get 6.5e-7
    + Terminal velocity is about 40 km/s
    + Hence we can calculate the wind momentum efficiency
      + \eta = Mdot V / (L/c)
      + = 3e-7 1.989e33 40 1.0e5 2.99792458e10 / 2000 3.82e33 3.15576e7 
      + = 0.298
  + *Conclusion: wind and radiation contribute equally!*

+ So this does show a gradient in f502n/f658n inside the continuum shell
  + This can't be due to continuum, so must represent a gradient in [O III]/[N II]
  + Suggests ionization front (or recombination front) before we get to the shell
+ We also use the ACS H\alpha filter, which also includes [N II]
+ And we can try and directly subtract the f547m continuum from the wfpc2 f658n filter


***** Flux calibration of the H\alpha image

+ This seems too large a difference - a factor of 10 in sensitivity
+ Ah, but we have to then multiply by bandwidth
  + This is 80 \AA for ACS f658n
  + 28.3, 39.2 for WFPC2
  + Still doesn't quite work
+ Also, this is for flux/pixel so we need to divide by pixel area!
  + Now we get within a factor of two or so, which is good enough
  + [ ] Other option would be to use the Doi & O'Dell calibration
+ So H\alpha brightness is about 0.001 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + Convert to emission measure
  + S = (\alpha_{eff} / 4\pi) h\nu EM
  + \alpha_{eff} = 1e-13 cm^3/s
  + h\nu = (1/4 - 1/9) 13.6 eV = 3.026e-12 erg
  + => EM = 0.001 / (1e-13 / 4 pi) 3.026e-12 = 4.153e22 cm^-5
+ RMS electron density
  + Assume L \approx R = 0.01 pc = 3.086e16 cm
  + n = sqrt(EM / L) = 1160 cm^-3
  + That sounds like a reasonable number, but might imply a small ionizing photon luminosity
    + Q_H = (4 \pi / 3) \alpha_B n^2 R^3 = (4 pi / 3) 2.6e-13 1160**2 (0.01 3.085677582e18)**3 = 4.305e43
    + *This is very faint!*


***** Compare empirical ionized density with expectations
+ We calculate around 1000 pcc from the H\alpha surface brightness
+ What is density expected from photoevaporation flow?
  + From above we had Mdot \approx 3e-7 Msun/yr and V \approx 40 km/s
  + So at R = 0.01 pc, we should have \rho = Mdot / 4 \pi R^2 V
  + => n = \rho / m = 3e-7 1.989e33 / 4 pi 3.15576e7 (0.01 3.085677582e18)**2 40 1.0e5 1.3 1.67262158e-24 = 181.693786957
  + Really, the measurement is at about half of the bow radius, so n = 730 cm^{-3}
+ That is very close to what is observed (1000 pcc), but it is all rather puzzling
  + The H\alpha brightness does not fall as r^{-3}, as one would expect from a wind
+ There is no visible ionized shell, as would be expected on the inside of the neutral shell
+ Could it be a recombination front?

**** Is LP Ori really a bow?
+ Other possibility is that it is just an asymmetric cavity
+ On the other hand, most "cometary reflection nebulae" are rather different
  + They tend to be centered on the star

+ [X] We will compare with the SED from a Cloudy model
  + For stellar SED, need to do extra foreground extinction
  + I was going to do it with pyNeb, but that only goes down to 1250 \AA
  + Other options:
    1. [X] Cloudy - I can run a special model with the star extincted by a certain column
       - This has to be done by running an actual model out to AV = 1.5, which we will try
    2. Look at getting Draine's extinction curve from somewhere
+ [X] And I also want to put on some magnitudes from the literature

+ Size: about 1.5 arcsec"

+ Stellar data
  + From \citep{Simon-Diaz:2006b}

+ *Low dust opacity*: from both the Fulgencio paper and from Salgado:2016a, it seems that the FUV opacity in the ionized and neutral gas is lower than in the general ISM
  + 1.6e-22 cm^2 / H => 74 cm^2/g in PDR
  + 2e-22 cm^2 / H => 92 cm^2/g in HII region
+ But /careful/, these are absorption cross sections, /and/ they don't take into account scattering - so I think they are underestimates
+ So they say that the grain size is large, which is why there is low opacity per unit mass
  + Up to 1 micron, supposedly
  + This also explains the lowish dust temperatures of about 100 K - it would be higher for smaller grains
  + This is because the reduced grain opacity means that Lyman alpha dominates the heating over most of the nebula
    + Note that from Smith:2005a, T is > 150 K in th1D arc, and 170 K in LV1 arc
    + But, again, there might be problems.  They are taking the dust T as being equal to the color T, but it is more complicated than that, with a distribution of dust sizes
    + Also, they assume gray body with a power law dust opacity, but there is a silicate absorption feature at 11 microns - so not sure how that works
    + So this is sort of in agreement with the Cloudy models - they show T ~ 300 K for 0.1 micron grains at 0.1 pc around the 40 Msun star
+ For th1D, we have R = 0.003 pc
  + so this would correspond to about 200 K for the biggest ISM silicate grains, which is indeed higher than is observed
  + For LV1 we have about 6.5 arcsec, so (0.013 / cos i) pc, say 0.02
  + This gives T of about 200 for the 0.1 micron grains, which is a little bit higher than the 170 K observed, but not by much
  + [ ] /need to work out color temperature of Cloudy models/
  + Robberto:2005a finds that color T calculated around 11 microns is higher than that calculated at longer wavelengths
    + this is not really surprising
    + mid-IR Qabs ~ a, so that \kappa ~ a^3, so goes with mass
    + but T ~ 122 D_{17}^{-1/3} a^{-1/6} with a in micron
      + Peak b-body wavelength = 20 micron @ 100 K, or 10 micron @ 200 K
      + So this means we will see the small grains at 10 microns and the large grains at 20 microns
    + This means that 0.02 micron grains will be twice as hot

+ We could use th1A as a template to subtract the PSF from th1D
  + There would have to be a snall brightness scaling, but they are pretty well matched
  + Of course, this smeans that CS emission around th1A would show up as negative, but hopefully that doesn't matter - there is one proply though I think

+ 20 micron is more problematic

    + From Robberto:2005a Fig 8 that should be 200 Jy/arcsec^2 at 20 micron and the same at 10 micron
    + So it would make sense if the 20 map were in Jy/pix
  + IRC4 has peak of 6 at 20 micron and 400 at 10 micron
    + So that should be 0.4 14.79 = 5.9 Jy/arcsec^2 at 10 micron

    + And should be 6 14.79 = 88.74 at 20 micron
      + Given as 101 in Table 4 - again close enough

+ Doing Epandas ellipse photometry at 10.1 microns
  + Total flux: (96141.966 + 77094.644)/1000 = 173.2 Jy
    + That is very close to the T-ReCS value at 11.7, but the BG values are very different
    + Area 1052 pixels = 74.83 arcsec^2
      + I don't understand why this is slightly smaller area than with T-ReCS, given that I copied the region over - but never mind
  + Box for BG, same as T-ReCS:
    + 1.499 +/- 6% Jy/arcsec^2
    + 112 Jy in the Epandas aperture, which is enormous
    + The problem here is that there is a glow underneath the MAX observations, and this BG box is right on its maximum - need to find a region that is more representative of the glow underneath th1D
      + This gives me 1.085 +/- 5% Jy/arcsec^2
      + Or 81.2 Jy in aperture, which seems about right, but I would put up the error to +/- 10
  + So BG-subtracted flux is
    + 173.2 - (81.2 +/- 10) = 92. +/- 10 Jy
  + Matching that to the peak-intensity derived fluxes, then implies an effective area of 92./131.5 = 0.70 nsr, which is like what we had anyway

****** TODO MSX
+ Take measurements in the same epanda aperture 

****** Converting to F_{\nu}, \nu F_{\nu}, \nu L_{\nu}, and \nu I_{\nu}
+ Radius of peak is about 3 arcsec, so that would give an area of
  + 28.3 arcsec^2
  + 0.665 nsr (nano-steradians)
  + Convenient, since multiply by GJy/sr to get Jy
  + Although we now use a column ~A~ to specify the effective area, which varies slightly between instruments
+ Using that would mean T-RecS gives 104.65 Jy
  + Compare with 228 Jy from Hale at same wavelength 
+ To get the SED, we have to multiply by \nu
  + \nu = c / \lambda = 2.9979e14 / \lambda(micron)
  + 1 Jy = 1e-23 erg/cm^2/s/Hz
  + So SED in erg/cm^2/s is 2.9979e-9 times F_\nu(Jy) / \lambda(micron)
+ To get luminosity, multiply by 4\pi D^2
  + For Orion: 2.011e43 to give erg/s
  + Or 5.2652e9 to give L_\odot
+ Or, we can just convert to intensity SED \nu I_{\nu}, as in Salgado:2016a Fig 6
  + Same as flux calculation
  + \nu I_\nu (erg/s/cm^2/sr) =  2.9979 I_\nu(GJy/sr) / \lambda(micron)
+ E.g., T-ReCS value @ 11.7 micron of 161.1 GJy/sr
  + \nu I_\nu = 41.3 erg/s/cm^2/sr
  + with A = 0.788 nsr: F_\nu = 127 Jy

+ Comments on the SED:
  1. Agreement is very good around 10 micron, three different instruments give F_\nu \approx 100 Jy, with the exception of Hale SpectroCam, which is about 200 Jy
  2. At 20 microns, there is much more disagreement, by a factor of 4
  3. The Sofia points are systematically low
  4. SED integrates to 310 Lsun
  5. If we use L_* = 2.95e4 Lsun, then we get \tau = 2 L_IR / L_* = 0.02
     - This is distressingly low!

****** Possible line contamination 
+ Br\alpha at 4.5 \mu

****** Modeling the SED
+ [ ] Need to run some Cloudy models
+ Comparison with Hayward:1994a two component models
  1. T = 358 K, \tau = 1.22e-4
  2. T = 117 K, \tau = 0.154
+ Note that Hayward did not have the longer wavelengths, so didn't need a very cold component
+ Comparison with Salgado:2016a models (at th1D position)
  1. T = 40 K, \tau = 0.1
  2. T = 110 K, \tau = 0.002
+ Note that Salgado doesn't have the 10 micron wavelengths, so doesn't need the hot component!
****** Comparison of luminosities
+ We have total Ney-Allen luminosity of 308.6 Lsun
+ Salgado:2016a have total luminosity of Orion Bar as 9500 Lsun
  + Check that I understand their map in Fig 9 correctly
    + 15 red pixels @ 40 = 600 Lsun
    + 29 purple pixels @ 30 = 870 Lsun
    + 28 blue pixels @ 20 = 560 Lsun
    + Sums to 2030 Lsun
+ Total IR luminosity of Trapezium region and Orion S
  + I can't find any actual calculations of this, but I will try and estimate from 
*** Extinction curves for Orion stars 
+ This all comes from IUE observations in Fitzpatrick:2007a
+ Relevant figures:
  + [[file:extinction-curves/fg4_8.h.jpg]]
  + [[file:extinction-curves/fg4_9.h.jpg]]
+ There are several Orion stars:
  + HD36982 - LP Ori
  + HD37020 - \theta^{1} A - B0.5
  + HD37022 - \theta^{1} C - O7
  + HD37061 - NU Ori - B0.5
  + HD294264 - V2239 Ori - B3 
  + Other, later B stars
+ Also some Carina stars from Tr16 in Fig 4.16
+ General properties of the Orion curves
  + All are similar in that they have high R_V and almost completely flat FUV curves
  + Most have very weak 2000 \AA bump, but LP Ori's is more normal
  + The graphs are all normalized by E(B - V), but if we normalize by A(1\mu{}m), as in lower panel of Fig 8, then things are clearer
    + Extinction hardly varies from 5000 down to 1200 \AA, and is about 2 to 3 times the 1 micron value
    + This is very different from general ISM, where extinction at 1200 \AA is 10 to 20 times the 1 micron value 
+ The Carina stars
  + These tend to have R_V = 3 to 4 and UV slopes that are steeper than Orion but less so than average ISM

Note (1): The stars are listed in order of increasing Right Ascension using the
          most commonly adopted forms of their names. The first preference was 
          ``HDnnn'', followed by ``BDnnn'', etc.  There are 185 survey stars 
          which are members of open clusters or associations.  The identity of 
          the cluster or association is either contained in the star name 
          itself (e.g., NGC 457 Pesch 34) or is given in parentheses after the 
          star's name. 
Note (2): Spectral types were selected from those given in the SIMBAD database,
          and the source of the adopted types is shown in the ``Ref''.  When 
          multiple types were available for a particular star, we selected one 
          based on our own preferred ranking of the sources. 
Note (3): The NGC 2244 distance is from Perez et al. (1987); the NGC 3293 
          distance is from Bolona & Crampton (1974); the Trumpler 14 and 16 
          distances are from Massey & Johnson (1993); the Cep OB3 distance is 
          from  Crawford & Barnes (1970).  The distances to all other clusters 
          or associations are from the Open Clusters and Galactic Structure 
          database maintained by Wilton S. Dias, Jacques Lepine, Bruno S. 
          Alessi, and Andre Moitinho at http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~wilton/.  
          For the non-cluster stars, distances were calculated using the 
          E(B-V) values from this study and the absolute magnitudes from 
          Turner (1980) (for mid-B and earlier types) and Blaauw (1963) 
          (for mid-B and later types).

Note (1): The stars are listed in order of increasing Right Ascension using the
          most commonly adopted forms of their names. The first preference was
          ``HDnnn'', followed by ``BDnnn'', etc.  There are 185 survey stars
          which are members of open clusters or associations.  The identity of
          the cluster or association is either contained in the star name
          itself (e.g., NGC 457 Pesch 34) or is given in parentheses after the
          star's name.
Note (2): For the O stars analyzed using the TLUSTY atmosphere models, the 
          values of Teff were adopted from the Spectral Type vs. T_eff_ 
          relation given in Table 2.  These stars can be identified by their 
          1-{sigma} uncertainties, which are {+/-}1000 K. 
Note (3): For stars in clusters, the surface gravities are determined as 
          discussed in S 3.1 and rely on stellar evolution models and cluster 
          distance determinations.  Surface gravities for non-cluster stars are
          not always well-determined, because of a lack of specific 
          spectroscopic indicators.  In some cases, the best-fit solutions for 
          these stars indicated physically unlikely results 
          (i.e., log(g) > ~4.3 or log(g) < ~3.0).  For these stars, a value of 
          log(g) = 3.9 was assumed (which is the mean log(g) of the rest of the
          sample) and a 1-{sigma} uncertainty of {+/-}0.2 was incorporated in 
          the error analysis.  These cases can be identified by log(g) entries 
          of ``3.9{+/-}0.2.''.
Note (4): For the O stars in the sample, our fitting procedure utilized solar 
          abundance TLUSTY models.  For these stars the values of [m/H] are 
          indicated by entries of ``0'' without uncertainties. 
Note (5): For the O stars, the adopted TLUSTY models incorporate 
          Vturb = 10 km/s.  For these stars the values of Vturb are indicated 
          by entries of ``10'' without uncertainties.  For the B stars, which 
          were modeled using ATLAS9 models, the values of Vturb were determined
          by the fitting procedure, but were constrained to lie between 0 and 
          10 km/s. Stars whose best-fit SED models required these limiting 
          values are indicated by Vturb entries of ``0'' or ``10'', without 
          error bars. The uncertainties for stars with best-fit Vturb values 
          close to these limits may be underestimated due to this truncation.

Note (1): The stars are listed in order of increasing Right Ascension using the
          most commonly adopted forms of their names. The first preference was
          ``HDnnn'', followed by ``BDnnn'', etc.  There are 185 survey stars
          which are members of open clusters or associations.  The identity of
          the cluster or association is either contained in the star name
          itself (e.g., NGC 457 Pesch 34) or is given in parentheses after the
          star's name.
Note (2): For the stars HD237019, HD18352, and HD25443 the long wavelength IUE 
          spectra are incomplete.  For these cases we constrained the UV linear
          extinction component to follow the relation c1 = 2.18 - 2.91*c2 from 
          Fitzpatrick (2004).  For these stars we list uncertainties for the 
          c2 values but not for the c1 values. 
Note (3): The uncertainties in the O2 and O3 optical spline points (at 
          wavelengths of 4000 and 5530 Angstroms, respectively) are tyically 
          0.01 or less and are not listed.  For several stars, those without U 
          band photometry, we did not solve for the O1 point at 3300 Angstroms.
Note (4): For field stars without IR photometry, we assumed R(V) = 3.1 and 
          kIR = 1.11, with the latter based on the relation 
          kIR = 0.63*R(V) - 0.84 from Fitzpatrick (2004).  For such stars in 
          clusters, we adopted the mean R(V) of the other cluster members and a
          value of kIR based on the aforementioned relation.  These assumed 
          values are listed in the Table without uncertainties.  Several survey
          stars have apparently noisy JHK data and yielded very uncertain 
          values of kIR.  For these, we ultimately derived the extinction curve
          by solving for the best-fit value of R(V) with kIR constrained to 
          follow the Fitzpatrick (2004) relation.  The resultant R(V) values 
          are listed with their uncertainties while the kIR values are listed 
          without uncertainties.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Dear authors

  I am writing with a query about the wind parameters of the star sigma
  Ori, on which you have published papers in the last few years (Najarro
  et al. 2011A&A...535A..32N; Simón-Díaz et al. 2011ApJ...742...55S,
  2015ApJ...799..169S).

  In the Najarro 2011 paper, an extremely low wind mass-loss rate of
  2e-10 Msun/yr is derived, mainly on the basis of Brackett alpha and
  other H lines.  However, as far as I can see, the analysis assumed a
  single star, whereas Simón-Díaz 2011,2015 establish that it is a
  triple system, consisting of 3 OB stars: sigma Ori Aa, Ab, and B, with
  masses in the range 10 to 20 Msun (see also Schaefer et al
  2016AJ....152..213S).

  So, my question is: how reliable is the mass-loss determination in the
  light of the triple nature of the system?  Is it possible that the
  Brackett alpha emission from Aa is actually stronger than it seems,
  but is masked by underlying absorption from the cooler photospheres of
  Ab and B?

  The reason for my interest is that I am currently working on
  theoretical models of infrared bow shocks, and sigma Ori is an
  interesting case where it has been proposed that it is radiation
  acting on dust, instead of the stellar wind, that forms the bow shapes
  (see Ochsendorf et al 2014, 2015).  The argument hinges on whether the
  wind is really quite so extremely weak as was derived in Najarro 2011.

  I would be very grateful for any comments you may have.

  Best wishes

  Will Henney

*** RCW 120, RCW 92
+ Ochsendorf:2014a
+ See also Mackey:2016a who say that RCW 120 is stellar wind bubble
+ These are a bit of a mess - the Ha is not obviously correlated with the 24 micron emission, but I'm not sure that this proves anything
  + The Ha emission from any bow shock or bow wave is probably weak

** Carina bow shocks
+ Smith:2010 Sexton:2015a, Kiminki:2017a
+ Ambient density about 1000 pcc
  + *But see below*
+ Velocities 10 to 50 km/s
+ Spectral types B0 to O7, plus some supergiants


*** Distance to Carina
+ I had been assuming 2 kpc
+ But Kuhn:2018a give 2600 +/- 300 pc
  + How would this be affected by the Stassun systematic offset?
  + 0.38 +/- 0.04 mas => 2.63 +/- 0.27 kpc
  + Stassun offset is -0.082 +/- 0.033 mas
  + This gives 2.16 +/- 0.24
+ Should actually use distance to \eta Car
  + 2.35 +/- 0.05 kpc
    + Implies parallax of 0.43 +/- 0.01 mas
    + Consistent with GAIA DR2 if offset -0.05 +/- 0.04
  + Smith:2006b
  + This should also apply to TR16 at least, and probably all of Carina

*** Main samples
+ Morphological Bow Shock Candidates
  + ERO 1-6 detected at 8 micron
    + ERO 4 best candidate for interaction with photoevaporation flow
  + ERO 36, 37, 39 detected at 24 micron
+ Color Bow shock Candidates
  + A few more of them

*** Special cases
+ ERO 18 is a B8 star - so almost no wind
  + Arc merges into a larger-scale structure
  + Has a blue [8]-[24] color, suggestive of PAH emission
    + Although perhaps it is the silicate feature
+ ERO 21 is a B1.5V star
  + No 24 micron measurement because saturated
  + Has a red [4.5]-[5.8] color, indicative of PAHs
    + So maybe not a wind bow shock, but could be radiation bow shock
  + Radius is 7.6 arcsec = 0.087 pc
    + If optically thick, we can calculate the pressure in the shell
    + L / 4 pi c R^2 = 6300 3.82e33 / 4 pi 2.99792458e10 0.073**2 3.085677582e18**2
    + P = 1.26e-9 cgs
    + External ram pressure = v^2 \rho = 2e-12 M^2 n
    + Ambient density is 630 / v10^2
      + I have calculated a better version of this including all regimes
    + Does the internal star dominate the ionization?
      + Flux from B1V star at 0.087 pc distance
        + S = 10^46 
      + Distance from luminous stars in Tr 14 is about 80 arcsec
        + 0.9 pc, so 10 times further 
  + Modelled as asymmetric bow shock by Ngoumo:2013a
    + The call it the "Sickle"
    + Has sub-mm clump just in front of it
      + Central column density of clump is 1.3e22 /cm^2 they say
      + Size is about 10 arcsec radius = 0.11 pc
      + So central density is about 2e4 pcc
    + Broad and narrow-band HST images show that the optical emission is all scattered continuum, with no detectable emission lines
      + small-scale shells closer to the star
  + Hartigan:2015a also comment on this object (sec 4)
    + They call it Tr 14 MJ 218
    + Morphology is unlike any of the bright-rimmed globule arcs that they see
    + In the Br-gamma minus H_2 difference map it shows up as H_2 bright on the right-hand flank
      - this is very weird
      - suggests that we have trapped the ionization front

***** Spitzer IRAC
We have up to 8 micron

***** Herschel
+ We have the SPIRE image at 250, 350, 500 micron
+ But we mainly want the 70 micron image, which must be PACS


**** More on the Sickle Nebula (ERO 21)
+ Stellar parameters
  + B1.5V
  + 2e4 Lsun
+ Coordinates
  + 
+ Interaction with Tr 14
  + HD93129Aa (O2 supergiant)
    + Luminosity 1.5e6 Lsun
  + Others in center
    + 3 times O3.5V => another 1.5e6 Lsun
  + Luminosity ratio
    + Bolometric is factor of 100
    + Stellar wind
      + \eta \approx 1 for supergiant (or at least > 0.1)
      + \eta < 0.01 for B1.5V star
      + So wind momentum ratio is 1000 to 1e4
  + Separation from central stars
    + About 80 arcsec, so about 0.9 pc
    + Bow radius is 0.1 times separation
  + 


*** What is the ionized density in Carina?
+ Sexton say 1000 pcc by referencing Brooks:2003a
  + But as far as I can see, Brooks are only measuring the density in the PDR and molecular clouds
    + They say that the PDR emission comes from "dust lane adjacent to Tr 14" and that density is 1e4 pcc and with G_0 = 1e4
    + But then they talk of a molecular cloud that the PDR overlaps with, and has density of 1e3 pcc
+ We can calculate the mean ionized density by assuming a Stromgren sphere
  + Tr 14 stellar population has S = 1.4e50 s^{-1}
  + Radius is about 2.6 pc
    + 4 arcmin at 2 kpc 
    + n = sqrt(S / (4/3) pi R^3 \alpha_B)
    + n = sqrt(3 1.4e50 / 4 pi 2.6**3 3.085677582e18**3 2.6e-13)
    + n = 500 pcc
    + So the RMS ionized density is pretty high!
+ We can also work out lower limit on wind cavity size, by assuming momentum balance
  + Mdot = 5.3e-5 and Vw = 3000 km/s
    + Note that these are from the Smith:2006a stellar parameters, which probably overestimate the wind strength
  + At 2 pc, Pram = Mdot Vw / 4 pi R^2 = 1.2e-9
  + Whereas gas pressure is 2 n k T = 1.4e-9
+ Amazingly, they are the same, which implies that the H II region should be a  shell, with even higher density
+ But this is not quite right:
  + that is just a high density PDR that is close to the dominant star, which is an O3I supergiant
  + the region as a whole is larger
    + The bows are spread over a region of radius about 1 degree
    + => 35 pc
  + We can add together Tr 14, Tr 15, and Tr 16 and the others
    + Smith:2006a
    + Total S = 9.1e50 /s
    + So with radius of 35 pc, this gives n = 26 pcc
    + Smith:2007b look at radio emission and find that it requires an effective S = 7e50 /s
      + Presumably, the rest has been absorbed by dust, or has escaped
      + This would then give an RMS density of 23 pcc over the 1 degree radius
+ However, there is much local variation
  + Smith:2004a find peak densities at the i-fronts of evaporation flows as 2000 to 6000 pcc
    + This is from Carina's defiant finger
+ Also Oberst:2011a claim that the average density is ≲ 100 pcc
+ Parkes 3.4 cm continuum map shows considerable structure, but dominated by large scale (tens of parsecs)
  + Car I accounts for only 5% of Tr 14's ionizing radiation (Smith:2007b)
  + Car II accounts for < 1% of Tr 15's ionizing radiation 
+ Measurements of [S II] ratio from Damiani:2016a
  + Median density of 100 pcc for approaching shell
  + Median density of 200 pcc for receding shell
  + Brightest regions have 2000 pcc, but fraction of nebula > 600 pcc is very small
+ Finally, 



*** Carina kinematics
+ Low mass cluster stars 
  + Damian:2016a
    + have V = -12 (approx) 
    + Range is -10 to -15
  + Damian:2017a
    + V = -7 (mean) HELIOCENTRIC
      + It seems that LSR is -8.8 km/s bluer => -16
      + But then Kiminki:2018a say it is 11.6 km/s difference
    + sigma = 3.5 km/s
  + Kuhn:2018a
    + Use proper motions from Gaia
    + 1D velocity dispersion is 2.5 to 3 km/s for each cluster: Tr 14, 15, 16
    + But, there are inter-subcluster differences of 5 to 8 km/s
      + For instance Tr 16 is moving towards Tr 14 at about 10 km/s
+ Ionized gas seems to be expanding shells
  + Damiani:2016a
  + Red component with V = +10 HELIOCENTRIC
  + Blue component with V = -30 HELIOCENTRIC
+ Molecular gas
  + Rebolledo:2016a
  + 12CO and 13CO
  + V(LSR) = -20 is typical
    + Implies about -10 heliocentric
  + Width not so clear, since they don't mention the instrumental resolution
    + FWHM ~ 5 km/s => sigma of 2 km/s
+ High mass stars have much higher dispersion
  + Hanes:2018a
    + -40 to +20
    + FWHM is about 40 km/s
    + Implying RMS sigma of about 17 km/s
    + If that is the 1D sigma, then the 3D sigma will be 30 km/s
  + Proper motions of bow shock stars also give about 30 km/s
    + Kiminki:2017a
    + But it is not necessarily aligned with bow shock axis
    + And may be upper limit
  + Kiminki:2018a
    + Smaller dispersion: 1D sigma = 9 km/s for their reliable sample
    + Mean is 0.6 km/s
+ Conclusion
  + Relative velocities of 20 to 40 km/s between star and environment are likely
  + Roughly equal contributions from star and environment




** Kobulnicky:2018a sample
+ [ ] There seems to be some overlap with the Carina ERO sample - check this out
+ [ ] There is another high-density example
  + KGK2010-2 in Cygnus OB-2
  + Spectral type is B1V, although luminosity class is uncertain
  + Ambient density is calculated as 160 pcc, but that assumes V=30 km/s
  + R = 0.07 pc, so very similar to Carina ERO 21

*** Cross checking the fluxes of the EROs
+ The fluxes given in Sexton:2015a paper are much larger than in Kobulnicky:2017a
+ I want to find out which is right, using the IRAC4 8 micron image
  + Units are MJy/sr = 2.35043863818e-5 Jy/arcsec^2
  + IRAC pixels are 0.6 arcsec => 8.46e-6 Jy/pixel
  + MIPS pixels are 2.45 arcsec
+ Worked example: ERO 21 IRAC4
  + 10h 44m 05.00s -59d 33m 40.0s Equ J2000
  + Peak intensity: 1800
  + BG intensity: 250
  + Pixel Widths: 11 x 25
  + Total flux: 8.46e-6 11 25 (1800 - 250) = 3.61 Jy

*** Densities and column densities
+ Kobulnicky:2018a find the stream density by
  1. Converting the 70 micron emission to column density, using Draine:2007a
  2. Using measured chord length to convert this into shell density
  3. Assume density jump of 4 across the shock to find the pre-shock density
+ Step 3 is the most problematic, since this only applies if the shock is non-radiative
  + For O9 and above, shock is strongly radiative above n = 1 for V = 30 km/s
  + So compression should be M^2 = 9, which is twice as high
+ Conclusion: stream densities should be 2 times lower, which implies /two times lower mass loss rates/
  + But we eliminate dependence on the stream velocity, since shell density is proportional to V^2, exactly the same as external ram pressure
+ We could also do an alternative method based on the column density
  + This requires knowing the shell thickness ratio, H/R, so we can estimate the limb brightening
  + Observed column from 70 micron surface brightness is n_1 L, where L is the chord length
  + Then use n_1 H = 3/4 n_0 R
+ Relating 70 micron emission to column density
  + Quantity j_\nu gives conversion: S_70 = j_\nu N_H
  + S_70 = 8e8 Jy/sr for brightest
  + j_\nu = about 1e-11, depending on radiation field at shell
  + => N_H = 1e20 H cm^-2
    + => \tau = 0.13
  + But this is across the chord length - the thickness will be less by a factor of 5-10, so \tau < 0.026
  + We can actually work it all out from the real data
    + Compare \tau and \eta as calculated from Kobulnicky:2018a data
    + The "radius" R and thickness H is given in the previous paper Kobulnicky:2017a
      + But note that R is not R0, but more like R90 (although as far as I can see, it is not measured from the star)
    + They also have a table with the R0 values (Kobulnicky:2017a Table 5) for just the sub-sample of known distance
      + But there are some inconsistencies:
        + Source 13 (zeta Oph): 29 (K17) versus 299 (K18) arcsec.  Clearly the second is correct
        + Source 331: 25 vs 42
        + Source 381: 71 vs 220
        + I will take the second one (K18) in all cases
    + Better idea - work out the optical depth from \tau = 2 L_{IR} / L_{*}

  + The third column is the forward difference, while fourth column is the centered difference, which should be better
  + So this would give a better total flux of
    + 2.4 S_8 + 1.6 S_24 + 0.51 S_70
    + Note that we are only using 3 bands
    + /Old version/:
      + 2.3 S_5 + 2.5 S_8 + 0.77 S_24 + 0.24 S_70 + 0.16 S_160
  + E.g., source 13 (subbing S_12 for S_8):
    + (2.3 8 + 2.5 51.32 + 0.77 343 + 0.24 246 + 0.16 62)
    + (18.4 + 128.3 + 264.11 + 59.04 + 9.92) = 479.77e-10 = 5e-8 as in Table!

    + (0 + 0.775 + 21.2982 + 1.056 + 0.864) = 23.99e-10 = 2.4e-9
    + This is less than 5% of the 6e-8 in table! That seemed to be based on a very high-T fit, which cannot be right.
  + So, in both cases, over 90% of total IR flux comes from 8, 24, 70 micron bands
  + In K17 they give peak S(70) in Jy/arcmin^2, whereas in K18 it is in Jy/sr

*** Compare KE flux with radiation
+ /actually all this is not necessary/
  + Draine:1981a shows that we need V > 200 km/s before a substantial fraction of the shock energy is radiated by dust
  + This is because grain cooling of the gas only becomes competitive above 1e6 K
  + For V = 100 km/s, the fraction is only 1%
    + This, combined with fact that shock energy is small fraction of absorbed radiative energy, means that collisional heating of the grains should be negligible
  + Note that the same shock velocities (> 200 km/s) are also those required to produce significant dust sputtering
    + V < 150 km/s, then grains of 0.01 micron can survive
    + V < 270 km/s, then grains of 0.1 micron can survive
+ KE flux passing through = P v / 2
  + P is ram pressure, v is stream velocity
+ Absorbed radiant flux = F (1 - e^{-\tau}) \approx F \tau
  + F = incident radiation flux
  + \tau = optical depth of shell
+ Also, we have
  + wind case (\eta > \tau): P = \eta F / c
  + radiation case (\eta < \tau): P = F (1 - e^{-\tau}) / c
+ So, we have shock heating / radiation heating:
  + wind case: 0.5 (\eta/\tau) (v/c)
  + radiation case: 0.5 (v/c)
+ Note that \tau = 2 x \tau_{\star}
  + wind case: x = \eta^{1/2}
  + rad case: x = 2 \tau_{\star} or \approx 1

+ K18 calculate G = F/F(Habing), which they call U
  + although actually /these are not the same/
    + First, they are working in terms of energy density not flux
    + Second, they are basing things on Mezger:1982a and Mathis:1983a who specify the entire SED of the IS radiation field.  This is what is used in Draine:2007a
    + Problem is that this Mathis field includes multiple cool stellar components that emit at longer wavelengths.  
    + I integrate the radiation field of Mezger:1982a Table C1
      + Take FUV range from 912 to 2000 Angstrom
        + \Delta\lambda = 0.11 \mu{}m
      + The average field there is about 15 in the table units
      + Units are 4 \pi J_\lambda / 1e-3 erg/cm^2/s/\mu{}m
      + So I get 4 \pi J_FUV = 15 0.11 0.001 = 1.6e-3 => *exactly the Habing value*
    + But the optical peak around 0.55 micron has 16.4, so adds another roughly
      + 16.4 0.55 0.001 = 9e-3 in same units
      + Optical emission is 6 times higher than FUV emission
    + Plus, they have another peak in the FIR
    + The total flux is 2.17e-2 erg/cm^2/s from Mathis:1983a
      + This means that the FUV flux is 0.074 times the total
+ Habing FUV version
  + F(Habing) = 1.6e-3 erg/s/cm^2
  + They find G values from 300 to 3e4
  + Using F = L / 4 \pi R^2, we get G = 200 L_{4} R_{pc}^{-2}
  + [ ] Need to compare this with their U to see how they are normalizing 


**** What Kobulnicky are doing with their model fitting
+ They claim to be calculating U from their stellar parameters:
  + U = \sigma T^{4} (R_{*}^{2} / R_{0}^{2}) / U_{0}
  + where U_{0} = 2.17e-2 erg/cm^2/s
+ And they should have L = 4 \pi \sigma T^{4} R_{*}^{2}
  + U = L / 4 \pi R_{*}^{2} U_{0}
  + U = 14.7 L_{4} R_{pc}^{-2}

+ LP Ori
  - this is very similar to our 10 Msun example star.
  - the 0.01 pc line is a very interesting one
    - if the relative velocity is low (< 20 km/s), then we are in the radiation-supported bow wave regime
    - if it is higher, then it may be a dust wave
+ \theta^1 D
  - This is part-way between the 10 and 20 Msun models
  - Low velocities, < 80 km/s or so, imply a radiation bow shock
    - With very high densities, > 1e5 pcc
    - Is this possible?

** Comments on \theta^{1} D and LP Ori fits

*** \theta^{1} D fits
+ E.g., [[file:arc-fits/th1D-75.pdf]]
+ The symmetry axis of the circle fits is always about PA175
  + This is different from the brightness axis, which is more like PA200
+ Also, it looks like we could maybe add some more arc points on the left hand side
  + This would mean we would get a proper R90 for that side

*** LP Ori fits
+ E.g., [[file:arc-fits/lp-ori-110.pdf]]
+ This is even worse
  + Symmetry axis of fits is around PA050
  + But global axis is more like PA010
+ The fundamental problem here is that the star position is too far from the symmetry axis of the bow, and this is what leads to the circle fit algorithm breaking down
*** TODO It might be better to fit a parabola to all the points
+ 4 parameters
  + (x, y) of apex
    + It might work better if this were specified by hand, perhaps guided by the maximum in brightness
  + position angle of tail
  + coefficient a in y = a x^2
+ Then can calculate the deviation of the central star from the parabola axis
+ And can do circle fit to the points around the axis, which hopefully will be more consistent than the unconstrained version
  + We could make a pseudo-center by projecting the star position onto the parabola axis
