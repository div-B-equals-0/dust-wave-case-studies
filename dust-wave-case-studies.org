Case studies of interesting objects for inclusion in bow paper II

* Selection criteria
+ High-ish ambient densities, since that is more likely to give an "interesting" case (e.g., radiation bow wave)
+ Prefer B stars to O stars, since then it is easy to get dust waves (gas--grain separation)
* Particular objects
** OB bowshocks in Orion Nebula
*** LP Ori
**** Info about star
+ Taken from [[file:~/Work/OrionNI/git-paper/models/individual/orion-stars.org]]
+ LP Ori (B1.5V) is 5 arcmin to the SSW of Trapezium
+ Parenago 1744 (B5V) is 12 arcmin to N of Trapezium

    + So this is consistent with the Spitzer position
+ So it is moving in roughly the right direction, but very slowly!

**** Info from ACS images
+ Lies just S of the bright bar
+ Size is roughly 3 arcsec, or 0.006 parsec
  + No, that is not accurate
    + 5.8 arcsec along global symmetry axis
      + => 0.012 pc
    + 5.0 arcsec along axis found by circle fit
+ Symmetry axis PA is about +20 deg
+ Dark cloud immediately to E
  + southern extension of SW cloud
+ Images to use
  + I have saved cut-out images in all the Robberto ACS filters
  + e.g., [[file:data/LP-Ori-HST/lp-ori-f435w.fits]]
  + A good RGB image is made from
    + R: f850lp 0..5
    + G: f555w 0..9
    + B: f435w 0..9
**** Spitzer images of LP Ori
+ There are several things in the [[file:data/LP-Ori-Spitzer/]] folder
  + But I don't remember what is what
  + In some of the images, LP Ori is totally saturated
  + One that shows LP Ori well
    + [[file:data/LP-Ori-Spitzer/r18172160/ch2/pbcd/SPITZER_I2_18172160_0000_4_E8245118_maic.fits][SPITZER_I2_18172160_0000_4_E8245118_maic.fits]]
    + But the resolution is much worse than in the optical
    + Coordinates are about 098-753

      + 83.791004 -5.4646746
**** Other available data
+ [X] Unfortunately, the new Bally observations (2016) do not cover LP Ori
  + The closest fields are the Beehive one (just to the east), and the Trapezium West one (just to the north), but it falls between the cracks
+ [X] Might there be newer Robberto images in f775w? Just like for the Western shocks
  + Yes there are - I am getting them now, together with some other recent observations, all from Robberto program 13826 in 2015-02

*** \theta^{1} Ori D
+ Size: about 1.5 arcsec"
  + => 0.003 pc
+ Stellar data
  + From \citep{Simon-Diaz:2006b}
  + M = 18 Msun
  + L = 2.95e4 Lsun
  + T_eff = 32,000 K
  + B0.5V 
+ *Low dust opacity*: from both the Fulgencio paper and from Salgado:2016a, it seems that the FUV opacity in the ionized and neutral gas is lower than in the general ISM
  + 1.6e-22 cm^2 / H => 74 cm^2/g in PDR
  + 2e-22 cm^2 / H => 92 cm^2/g in HII region
+ But /careful/, these are absorption cross sections, /and/ they don't take into account scattering - so I think they are underestimates
+ So they say that the grain size is large, which is why there is low opacity per unit mass
  + Up to 1 micron, supposedly
  + This also explains the lowish dust temperatures of about 100 K - it would be higher for smaller grains
  + This is because the reduced grain opacity means that Lyman alpha dominates the heating over most of the nebula
    + Note that from Smith:2005a, T is > 150 K in th1D arc, and 170 K in LV1 arc
    + But, again, there might be problems.  They are taking the dust T as being equal to the color T, but it is more complicated than that, with a distribution of dust sizes
    + Also, they assume gray body with a power law dust opacity, but there is a silicate absorption feature at 11 microns - so not sure how that works
    + So this is sort of in agreement with the Cloudy models - they show T ~ 300 K for 0.1 micron grains at 0.1 pc around the 40 Msun star
+ For th1D, we have R = 0.003 pc
  + so this would correspond to about 200 K for the biggest ISM silicate grains, which is indeed higher than is observed
  + For LV1 we have about 6.5 arcsec, so (0.013 / cos i) pc, say 0.02
  + This gives T of about 200 for the 0.1 micron grains, which is a little bit higher than the 170 K observed, but not by much
  + [ ] /need to work out color temperature of Cloudy models/
  + Robberto:2005a finds that color T calculated around 11 microns is higher than that calculated at longer wavelengths
    + this is not really surprising
    + mid-IR Qabs ~ a, so that \kappa ~ a^3, so goes with mass
    + but T ~ 122 D_{17}^{-1/3} a^{-1/6} with a in micron
      + Peak b-body wavelength = 20 micron @ 100 K, or 10 micron @ 200 K
      + So this means we will see the small grains at 10 microns and the large grains at 20 microns
    + This means that 0.02 micron grains will be twice as hot




** Ones in Ochsendorf papers

*** \sigma Ori
+ Coordinates:
  + Equatorial: 05h38m42s -02d36m00s
  + Galactic: 206.81067369 -17.34616728
+ Ochsendorf:2014b, Ochsendorf:2015a
+ Stellar parameters (from them)
  + binary O9.5V + B0.5V
  + L4 = 6.02, so like the 20 Msun case
  + \eta = 0.0697 or 0.0002 - they prefer the second
    + [ ] They cite Najarro et al 2011 - need to check it out
+ To get a dust wave, we need that \eta is small or V is large
  + V large is definitely ruled out
    + Star has V = 15 km/s
    + Isothermal photoevaporation flow has
      + M_{1} / M_{0} = sqrt(1 + 2 ln(\rho_{0} / \rho_{1}))
      + They say \rho_{1} = 10, \rho_{0} = 100 pcc, so M_{1} = 2.37 M_{0}
      + So with M_{0} = 1 and c_{s} = 11 km/s \Rightarrow V = 26 km/s
  + So how small does \eta need to be?
    + v_10 > sqrt(\Xi_{\dag }\eta)
    + so we need \Xi_{\dag }\eta < 9 where \Xi_{\dag }\approx 3000 for O stars
    + \eta < 0.003
+ In IC 434 H II region
  + Photoevaporation flow has supposedly fallen from 100 pcc at i-front to 10 pcc
+ Fiducial radius
  + R_* = 2.21 sqrt(L4/n) / v10
  + = 0.7 pc
+ Rip point radius
  + R_\dag = v10 R_* / sqrt(\Xi) = 1.7 / sqrt(\Xi)
  + So \Xi = 300 required to match observations of 0.1 pc
  + Unless arc radius is not the rip point
+ Observed arc radii
  + R = 0.1 pc for inner dust wave (dust T about 70 K)
  + R = 1 pc for outer dust wave, which may or may not exist (dust T about 20 K)


**** Evidence that ODW is in the ionized gas

**** Calculations for the inner dust wave
+ [ ] General structure
  + Line-of-sight depth of evaporation flow
    + Width is about 20 arcmin => 2 pc
    + Radius of H II region is about 40 arcmin => 4 pc
      + RMS density, assuming S = 7.6e47
        + 4/3 pi R**3 n**2 alpha = S
        + n = sqrt( 3 S / 4 pi R**3 alpha) = 20 pcc
  + Size and thickness of bow
  + Timescale for photoevaporation flow
    + Size about 3 pc
    + Velocity about 20 km/s
    + => 0.15 Myr, which is less than the stellar age
    + On the other hand, it is similar to the crossing time of the star if its proper motion is really 15 km/s towards the horsehead
+ [ ] Dust density and temperature
  + Optical depth map at 70 micron given in Fig 3 of Och15
    + Morphology similar to the Ha bow
    + Peak is around 1.8e-5
    + extended plateau from photoevaporation flow is about 1e-5

+ These are continuum images and spectra
+ The images seem quite high resolution
  + But the bigger fields have a strange spiral pattern of instrumental scattered light, which means it is impossible to see the dust wave

+ Sexton:2015a, Kiminki:2017a
+ Ambient density about 1000 pcc
+ Velocities 10 to 50 km/s
+ Spectral types B0 to O7, plus some supergiants

* Types of bow

| object | Sp. type | T_eff, K |  L_4 | R_0, pc |

+ LP Ori
  - this is very similar to our 10 Msun example star.
  - the 0.01 pc line is a very interesting one
    - if the relative velocity is low (< 20 km/s), then we are in the radiation-supported bow wave regime
    - if it is higher, then it may be a dust wave
+ \theta^1 D
  - This is part-way between the 10 and 20 Msun models
  - Low velocities, < 80 km/s or so, imply a radiation bow shock
    - With very high densities, > 1e5 pcc
    - Is this possible?

* Fitting the arc shapes

** Comments on \theta^{1} D and LP Ori fits

*** \theta^{1} D fits
+ E.g., [[file:arc-fits/th1D-75.pdf]]
+ The symmetry axis of the circle fits is always about PA175
  + This is different from the brightness axis, which is more like PA200
+ Also, it looks like we could maybe add some more arc points on the left hand side
  + This would mean we would get a proper R90 for that side

*** LP Ori fits
+ E.g., [[file:arc-fits/lp-ori-110.pdf]]
+ This is even worse
  + Symmetry axis of fits is around PA050
  + But global axis is more like PA010
+ The fundamental problem here is that the star position is too far from the symmetry axis of the bow, and this is what leads to the circle fit algorithm breaking down
*** TODO It might be better to fit a parabola to all the points
+ 4 parameters
  + (x, y) of apex
    + It might work better if this were specified by hand, perhaps guided by the maximum in brightness
  + position angle of tail
  + coefficient a in y = a x^2
+ Then can calculate the deviation of the central star from the parabola axis
+ And can do circle fit to the points around the axis, which hopefully will be more consistent than the unconstrained version
  + We could make a pseudo-center by projecting the star position onto the parabola axis
