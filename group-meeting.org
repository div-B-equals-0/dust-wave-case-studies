* Is Carina's Sickle Nebula a bow shock?

** Motivation

+ Bow shocks occur when luminous stars interact with a moving supersonic stream
+ Models predict that for high-density ambient streams, we don't have a normal hydrodynamic wind-supported bow shock, but instead:
  - Radiation-supported bow wave (optically thin to UV), or
  - Radiation-supported bow shock (optically thick to UV)
+ /Show figures 1 & 2 from paper/
+ Ambient density > 100 cm^-3 is required
  + Larger than typical for the ISM
+ We need to look for spatial coincidence of
  1. OB stars
  2. Dense-ish gas
+ => Young rich cluster => *Carina?* 

** Quick facts about Carina

+ Distance: 2300 pc
+ Size: 2 deg => 80 pc
+ Several high-mass star clusters:
  + Trumpler 14
    + Younger (1.5 Myr), more compact (2 pc)
    + Contains O3 supergiant
  + Trumpler 16
    + Older (2-3 Myr), more spread out
    + Contains \eta Car
  + Others: Tr15 (old), Bochum 11 (very young), etc
+ /Show Smith:2007b Figure 1/
+ /Show ESO and HST images/
+ Total luminosity
  + L(IR) \approx 10^7 L_\odot (half of stellar output)
  + L(H\alpha) \approx 10^5 L_\odot (but 2/3 absorbed by dust)
  + Q_H \approx 10^51 s^-1
  + Similar to 30 Dor, or 100x Orion Nebula

** Carina's EROs

+ Extended Red Objects
  + Smith:2010b, Sexton:2015b, Kiminki:2017a
  + strong in Spitzer IRAC band 4 (8 \mu{}m)
  + some discovered at 24 \mu{}m
+ Bow shock candidates 
+ We look for those in the densest parts of the nebula
  + Ionized gas has median density of 200 cm^-3
  + Lots of local variation: 20 \to 2000 cm^-3
+ Neutral/molecular gas can be denser
  + 1000 \to 10^4 cm^-3

** Sickle Nebula (ERO 21)

+ /Show in ESO NIR image/
+ Hartigan:2015a Fig 10
  + No bright Br-gamma emission
    + \therefore Cannot be an illuminated pillar
  + Does show H_2 2.12 emission on one side
    + \therefore Must have a PDR (optically thick to FUV)
+ Ngoumou:2013a
  + UCAC4 catalog gives 95 \pm 52 km/s proper motion
    + /but note that GAIA gives no PM for this star/
  + Conclude ambient density of 0.1 \to 20 cm^-3
  + But this would give a H column of \sim 10^18 cm^-2
    + \tau(FUV) < 0.005
    + Would not be bright in mid IR, and would not show H_2 emission
+ Sexton:2015a
  + Mid IR colors make them doubt that it is a bow shock
    + [4.5]-[5.8] indicates PAH /show Fig 5/
    + But that just means it isn't a *normal* bow shock

** Conclusions

+ If it is a bow shock it must be slow-moving in a dense neutral environment
  + V = 3 - 5 km/s
  + Proper motion must be wrong
+ May be a radiation-supported bow!
